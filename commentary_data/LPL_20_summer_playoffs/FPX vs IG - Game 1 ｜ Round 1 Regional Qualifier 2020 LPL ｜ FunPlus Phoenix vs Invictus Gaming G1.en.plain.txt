it does offer some crazy shenanigans in the mid lane i've seen to be spamming the renekton but we do get the ash here it gives lwx prio in the bot lane which is something fpx love to try and set up those dives or roams and help tn out in the early game it's kind of funny we'll talk a little bit about shenanigans as we go through this after you've had a big look at solo queue sir but things standard so far with the graves nautilus for ig ning on the graves and the funny thing about this is you must be thinking why are ig first rotationing nautilus it's because crisp has played 21 games of nautilus to split his second most played champion is leona at eight it's uh it's a lot to say the least right and balaam we know that's his most play too i think a lot of fans are probably happy though that chris wasn't getting his hands on the nautilus after the performance against oh my god it has been middling right um but now we do see tien going over to that kindred it has been something he's been playing a lot in solo queue we've seen it favored by junglers like kenavi coming into playoffs so obviously fbx taking a page of their their book and there is the galio that munchables and dagda was talking about this is something that dwindby does exceptionally well on and can look to you know enable his sidelines hit those sides right dive bot look at fpx and their original style of 2019. he's taking a page out of that while invictus gaming this could be setting up a safer bottom line with this center given over the puff and it always signals us that we're going to be playing towards the soul lanes which when you have ig on the rift is something you want so i like it right now we have a carry jungler coming out we're gonna have the donning shadows coming out from the sena later on you have a bunch of bursts when you look at fpx's comp so far with that kindred ultimate it does pretty well surviving that initial burst which means we go into the second band phase with fpx looking to target out those solo lanes but ig a couple more supports to take off the board and an interesting thing is renekton has not been picked or banned yet of course it is a very gimgun style champion not something we'd expect to see the shia on he's actually only played it once this summer knowing ig i would expect them to pick up mid on their fourth pick rookie of course has a lot of blindable champions the orianna's been his go-to this split his second most played is the azir and i feel like you can insert any mid lane into this comp pretty easily but it would be nice to see rookie on something that is a bit more of a lame bully maybe you can see something what do you reckon i was gonna say you probably bring the zoey out but you are facing the galio another potential option is reaching down in your pool and bringing out something like a corki which we haven't seen in a long time but that is a counter into the galileo it also does quite well to the kindred because you don't have to commit into going into her and you know going to the lamb's bike i guess the bonus is here that both rookie and the shy have large champion pulls the shy especially 15 unique champions played so hard to ban him away but seeing the fiora may open something up as the nikko is a flex this has been a signature of rookie though all year long of course it did get some buffs so it's nice to see him on it it does fine into the galleo match up very hard from he'll keep those all ends on you with those tangle barbs and this is strange because we saw it in their last match against v5 that we did they're playing with kim goon but they're putting him on all these con style champions that's right but we do know that kim goon and solo queue this has been spammed a lot as of recently and we know that gim goon in seoul has always been different to competitive play at least until now and what we saw against b5 chris going to put himself on a hook champion while we get fbx's draft which is gonna be quite different to what we're used to and a monarchism for the shy he started playing this champion this year for the first time and i think he likes it he's fallen in love with it right it's even funny because if you follow the shine solo queue he's almost always exclusively played 80 carries in james but he's actually been playing this a lot recently as well so ig going back to a comp that's very comfortable for them the thing that's interesting is it does very well when the enemy wants to come into them of course having the death realm to dissuade any engage nico as well with her ultimate being able to lock those carries down but for the side of fpx they do have that engage they do want to go in but they can also just hold the enemy at bay play through their side lane pressure because camille plus galio is such good luck i was going to say there's a lot of options for doom b here with camille top with the ash and the thrash bottom a lot of cc to play through and windows for fpx might be the way to go in game one i like fpx's comp a lot i definitely feel like they came out ahead with this strap because like you're saying they have more options when you have more options that's always nice to go through but i feel like you can't just look at these drafts on paper and say which is right which is wrong and we have fpx playing camille top like this is not what kim goon has been known for this past year especially but even going back further in his career right it's been about those tanks and bruises in the top lane if not a tank of bruiser the gp whereas on the other side let's just quickly run into ig because we see the mordekaiser we see the nikko we see ning on a graves and you talked about the center being able to hold that bottom line while our solar lanes are going to be the priority much as we know with invictus gaming yeah and again i can see how their draft functions but i don't think there's any great windows for ig to play around there isn't like really any good gank set up right i guess you have a bit of cc in mid lane you do have mix damage coming out on both of your soul lanes but camille extremely mobile galio as well how's that e2 get away or the taunt trying to get out of there what i expect ig to do is to try and get that prior on the mid lane and enable ning to play an aggressive dueling style in the river but ladies gentlemen where the gio's at what happened and these are the teams you think would have the most they would absolutely that arena right now if we had people in it would be completely packed i dare say as much as the grand final just a heads up this is our regional qualifier this is day two of our regional qualifier one of these world teams is going home it's do or die and one team has the verse lgd the funny thing about this is ig were in the exact same position in 2019 summer they beat jdg 3-2 then they got into the regional finals versus top esports and three to them as well they have to do the same thing against fbx and lgd at least they have the audience behind them yep the western audience being a big fan of ig and obviously ig has been much more of a a staple over the years obviously winning worlds in 2018 rookie has been around for so long 2015 spring yep i mean even further than that you know going back to champions in korea back in the day but spent more time here in china in in the lpl i mean has been five years yeah a lot of time but people might have been wondering was he a season one player uh no sir no he was not but he's a damn good player that's for sure glacial augment coming out of the nico mid and the harassed ability of a w start with the bit of attack speed and the third hit this is just standard on nikko it's nice to have the glacial to set up all of your abilities right you have a skill shot in your q skill shot cc so it's nice she doesn't really uh pair too well with any of the other runes the interesting thing that for me is that we see doing be going back to this predator galleon we saw a thought of prevalence when the change came and now you do get that movement speed when you're moving towards enemy target rather than just outright which a lot of players didn't like because it takes away a lot of the utility yeah but at least you know running at a player with shield of durant gives you a bit of that momentum as chris now and lwx are targeting bow land these are really good trades they end up winning out the sustain of puff is not that large here in the early game until wx and chris will hit two an important thing to note is ig's comp is definitely the one that needs to start getting ahead sure you have things like cena that do scale quite well but on the opposite spectrum you have a kindred in the jungle you have this camille who's going to be able to outdoor the mordekaiser in the death room later on playing are we sure this is gim goon because tien's ganking top the hook shot wall shot plus the flash for the shy burns are too early on this morning guys are one two and three and you know what that's a very the shy first blood munchable said they had 18 days to repair so of course fpx weren't going to come in with the standard stuff clearly adapting their play style and let's remember this is how teams continuously punished ig early on in the split was just camping the shy top level two and first blood goes over to fpx i mean the shy dies immediately as teleport the wife getting pushed and he's walking back that is a big advantage to start the kindred off with it goes back to our conversation earlier that you know tien has set up in his lanes tian has numerous ways to play off this game to where ig just don't exactly have those options we can see ningx still just going through and full clearing his jungle tien though his mark was set up for the top side this is perfect to go oh yeah just go straight out for the dive this grass gonna be pretty crucial if this goes through kim goon the rest of the wave coming in it does look like he's just going to recall and make sure that ning isn't looking for any cheeky ganks on top side with kim boone having to crash that wave into turret to get the bounce back ladies and gentlemen please note this is not ning this is rookie who's walking down ning's actually in the river responding with the other scuttle and the way we go it's a bit interesting right where we have teams kind of trading sides in a sense where fpx are on top side and now ig getting full control of bot we do see ning trying to steal those raptors right now of course for ps priority and ig's bot lane is on the way first but again to reiterate your point we want to see ig getting the ball rolling early that's why top side gank is very good for fbx to kick this game off and we want to see it happen through mid because that's really the only place it could happen i do like what they did there to where once again rookie has the prio and mid so just push out enable ning to look for these steals enable ning to look for these duels where you can always follow first and have that numbers advantage but at least when you talk about a comp of ig that wants fbx to come into them and they're okay with that double glacial with this nikko with the center being able to pull back and the mordekaiser can separate one member feels like for ig you know those one two items around the objective is gonna be a lot of fun to watch fpx also on a team that we expect to play perfect league of legends right so they are going to make some missteps the good thing for them is they don't really need to run into ig they can just play back try to set up those sides later on i mean you know once we do get a few items under our belt camille definitely going to be able to outdoor the mordekaiser into the death realm yeah but it's nice that rookie got a lame bully champion because this is where nico thrives uh you know those early levels being able to pull out especially with the ranged advantage in this galio having trouble to set up that e into taunt combo because the tangle bombs can just stop you in your tracks and he's doing the most with his with his advantage almost 20 cs up already and we know the guys are talking about extended laning phases for ig works out nicely however for the shy probably wants this to end as soon as possible because tien's up top side ning nearby with a level advantage as the shah is just waiting for this wave to push it i expecting to come up to secure that the shy can push his wave in he might just back off and try to catch it safely we do see that ning is heading to the raptors because that's where ken's mark is but doumby's coming in as well it's only level five but shield ground will do enough walking into brush the lens helps out as rookie now has the pop blossom available they might be trying to sandwich this one both have a level lead but chris was here that's the difference and the mark given over so two early marks for tien on this kindred and this is a throwback to 2019 where we would see chris find a lot of these clutch realms off of those early recall timings fx's bot lane got the recall first so that's why chris was able to get here early but fallout balance waiting in the wings to match i just love though that seeing balan with the match as you pointed out is going back to the story that that the guys on the desk talk about you know ning and bow land have been grouping up there has been a lot more synergy between the two and bow land coming in has led this roster to you know new highs until they got to the quarterfinals which let's be fair that series reminded me of spring ig when they faced the star looked like they had no prep whatsoever because they kept i'm gonna stop yeah that land goes forward we expect a bit of blood in the series the dredge line into the wall the death sentence reconnects onto the jungle as well sets up the level six galio still be flies even double knock up the pop blossom hits down under two and you know what rookie better than doing me at this point as being gets faulted up engaged on because kim good has flown in the tp from the shy a little bit too late he gets the red buff probably happy about that but can't use his death realm well i mean one for one and your top laner gets the red buff i think ig overall are feeling good especially when the fact is right it's hard for them to create a lot of these windows they're going back to play the way we expected right of abusing their lane priorities to set up four nings and vades and i really liked rookie he was uh disguised so came in with the ultimate which didn't have the the channel time set up just went straight in du indy got locked down we saw tian get locked down as well chris was the one who ultimately went down on the side of nps and rookie getting the kill off that fight screams to me that all right well even though gibson picked up one and the sideline threat is huge hold the phone balance to burn his flash and getting caught out in the lane chris have been laning well so far lyric and i'm gonna avoid my earlier point because this is a level six bottom lane soon to be for chris burke they do have a nice matchup though having the ash almost always secures you lane priority in situations like this chris though still wanting to be this aggressive playmaker and both teams even right now just gonna reiterate that does spell good things for the side of fpx zombie was heading on up just to clear some vision with rift hold now available gets vision of raptors sees it ning is not there yet the thing that is nice about this mordekaiser pick in a sense is the fact that you can't have this dual camille into galio play or at least it's gonna be a lot harder to execute right because you're going with the hex like ultimatum mordekaiser pulls you to the death row galio now has nothing to follow up on he goes for nothing just has to hold his head in his hands still too long when you're winning the matchup regardless though i don't think you feel too bad as fbx not being able to look for that play harold's being started here though lyric and when i say start i mean almost done ig are not here for the play and it's just gonna go down tien with a good early jungle game you could see that ig wanted to react they came up i just realized they were a bit short of course you don't need to rotate puff over because he does have that donning shadows to come out across the map but as you said tien having a good game so far putting a lot of good pressure on topside now picking up that herald the question is going to be where do they drop it they haven't gotten any plates as of yet so there's no like clear target when you look at this comp you would expect they want to put it towards top side geek engine rolling but you do have very good setup in the bottling with that enchanted crystal arrow yeah you really do back up and available chris will hit six soon i've said that before as i also want to ask you lyric what happens with the lead rookie has built up in this lane about 30 cs already and the kill how do ig translate that so it's exactly as we see here on our screen right he's gonna be able to constantly out trade unbe in the mid lane it's going to enable him to move on the map morris set up for these shuttles potentially set up for this fight at drake for ig and we saw it in the last red buff invade where hey you can get a nice stretch line coming in bait fpx in and set up for a massive ultimate coming out from rookie unfortunately nothing happens in the bottom lane so he's gonna be walking back for now there's that dragon staring them in the face ning gets positional advantage with the wards put down tier now hovering in the back of the wave he'll get spotted out that herald as you mentioned will be decided to go so they are pushing out again this is where all their tools are they have the priority in the bot lane with the ash they do pick up one plate should be able to get a few more now i wonder if fps will be willing to turn to drake it doesn't look like it because we do see that rookie has matched the rome on the side this guy says balan and now ning everyone backs away too dumb he has tp and ulti but will be far away i was gonna say we can actually see ig be a bit cheeky right now and potentially just start this drake up knowing that the members of fpx would go for those recalls especially with the mark spawning on the top half of the map he's just gonna say you know what i wish it did with niko i wish you know as graves you got the double shot in so it was a bit more convincing that it was a clone even if it didn't do the damage with things like wars i should be a developer yes you should maybe i will become like jet one day so you're gonna go to be a developer come back to casting and then go coach we gonna coach ghostbusters um v5 maybe well you are taking my dreams lwx has the aero the shy again you talked about this interaction though and chances are away from the shy little docido side step but remember fbx have grouped up as four in this top lane so i'm not sure it's gonna end here and we need to remember that the rift herald should be the next objective to come up so getting this swap is quite nice it looks like they're potentially going to send him now down to the bot lane they don't have that engage tool coming out from the ash anymore so realistically fpx don't have a way of forcing a fight if they want to also note that don't be stuck in this mid lane for now up against rookie once again 30 cs behind yeah consistently right and i'm still waiting for that buy to come back because there is a stopwatch in the inventory as a priority for rookie and that pop blossom of course the interaction after the whole stasis feels pretty nice looking now on the mend after clearing out that wave to do the same for some vision and now holding bot now we expect to see ig get control of that top side river we do see that fbx do still have some vision left over we see rookie leaning in they're going to clear that out take the scuttle crab it i expect him to go into fpx's top side jungle maybe try to set up some deep vision and look for any picks but realistically i don't think they have a way of setting up a dive on top side are looking for these easy ganks lwx and crisp are quite safe yeah fox makes it super hard as well tien going to be taking away a mark what's he at oh okay range advantage now given over is the shy you know what and normal the shy would alt that straight away but decides not to considering that uh the gromp is gone they're gonna get a bit information on tien he does have ninja tabi's and secrets arm guard so he's feeling quite fine into this 1v1 especially because hasn't picked up his trinity force yet but he's very close i mean that carl almost done tien here still hovering once again and he even has i mean even has his uh passive on to the shy so we know exactly what fps want to do but here we go level 10 versus level 9 gimgoon dodges away from the maze depth i'm going to be using there's the interaction with doom but the problem is one versus three as he comes on out and given definitely isn't gonna die dodgers away they're shy welcome to your hell zero into his chat across the arrow was not really necessary but worth a shot doesn't matter if the combo doesn't work out the you know clean and cut way it's supposed to you still lock them down you still lock him down in the lane it still gives enough time for enough members to come to secure that and fps use that window to secure the spotlight early gold lead here is teleport used to defend even go on the offensive with chris and the death sentence they won't be able to connect doom b after the back top loss are coming in tien is blind oh my lord what a beautiful creation nico is rookie massive showing us why he has always gone back to this pick throughout the year doing a great job so far but you pointed out earlier right fpx are the ones with the gold lead we've even seen it continuously throughout this game that fpx have all the options they can make the place within crystal arrow they can make plays on the opposite side of the map coming out from the hextech ultimatum and ig right there rookie just relied on tien going too far forward isn't it really stereotypical of what this season has been when ig in the top side failing where ning hasn't been able to get so far off the ground by the cs advantage we're seeing rookie really is that standout for ig as it's been all season the nice thing for rookies on the niko is your build is just so cheap all of your items the glp the twin shadows you do get those core items very early on and that's another reason why niko is kind of such a nice mid game champion because you come online so much earlier than every other champion of the game just the amount of bursts this is an action replay look at this all right we'll try that one again in a second you know you know what tien put that replay up that's why that's why it didn't work the end didn't want to see it he cut it getting calm let's stop that so epics are starting to stop and balance posturing like they want to contest we see the other members heading over now spotted there's two of them and tp is going to be coming in from kim june as you mentioned nice call technical items available harold just goes down rg down the choke but hooked out by chris there's gonna be no further engage they've already gotten the herald they can just walk this shows right we've said ig want the enemy to engage into their comp but fbx have no reason to do that they don't need to go in they got the objective they already had a turn on bot side so ig right now are just matching one for one and lwx is getting all that that three cs and top side getting an exp advantage getting a gold advantage to her ig are sharing all this gold in exp in the mid lane well you can see it's only like the one items across the board for the shy he doesn't even have his first item so we're even seeing a trade that we've seen consistently throughout playoffs where you know one team will just continuously opt out for those early drakes and just snowball this gold advantage and those are typically the teams we've seen come out ahead because when that third drake comes they're at higher item power spikes are able to take these fights quite well and so far fpx are the ones set up in that position let's just remember ig working towards an infernal rift with two dragons in their back pocket already when we talked about the team that needed to really snowball and push ahead while they haven't done that an infernal soul is a condition that could help net them some more momentum jim goon right now sitting with the most gold in the game but gamegood and tien both doing such a good job to go forward obviously the standout member for ig is rookie yeah sitting with about a 1k gold lead over doing b he's actually matching kim jones gold at the moment as well so you can see eyes on kimcoon for fpx eyes on rookie for invictus gaming and i was coming into today expecting a lot of blood a lot of matching a lot of chaos but in this game one it's been based on the picture of the early game that tien set up the top side it's been based on ig's rookie trying to find momentum as well ig have the highest champion kills per minute in the lpl if you include all of playoffs you include all the regular splits so bloody games are definitely what you see with ig fpx have been a bit of a slower team they usually have a much faster like first five minutes as we've seen they're very good at finding those first bloods and getting those early ganks off but that's typically when we've seen them not exactly take their foot off the gas but i mean you were talking about this earlier they are typically the author of their own demise they look for but at least with a comp like this at least with the drop we talked about terrell gets charged down through the mid lane with the lead already on gimgun with him farming away they are set up for their own success as well narrowly misses doomy gets away in time midterm defended lwx almost goes down pup has his ulti but doesn't think he can kill lwx and i tend to agree with him at this point in the game without one of those second items in his back pocket so lmx gets away turret holds for ig and the farm continues ladies and gentlemen five kills at 18 minutes a lot we'll eventually ramp this one up for you don't worry but now all those reasons coming out we'll take a look at itemization it's interesting to note that the shy went for the nashers to start which is typically more of a like dueling point of death realm getting that 1v1 item rather than you know something like leandries which is much more about team fighting playing with your your passive aura around you dealing all that damage procking that on everyone or something like uh protobelt which can get you onto the carry even faster because we have a jewel gimgun at this point he got an early trinity force he beat the shy to the one-armed mark but i see the seekers i see the defensive capabilities now for the shot he also has conquer so he will do better in the extended trade especially now i i still think he he definitely comes out ahead that one v1 he's still sitting on the seeker's arm guard of course so having the armor as well as the name definitely yeah definitely helps i'll be curious though as we get towards the death stance for gimgoon as his second item because he is in a very favorable position uh he's down cs but again that kill early with the couple assists helps him along we've also seen and we can even see right now on the minimap that all of fbx's members are continuously just pushing sides and hovering me they are looking for these group that plays they're prepared for anything that ig can throw their way and i expect to see them continuously set up for kind of like a two-line setup where we'll work we'll see kim goon pushing out aggressively but doing b typically should just be catching waves on the weak side of the map it should be a lot more about tien playing with gimbon as we've seen all game long yeah the threat of doom b as well we know what galio is he hovers between skirt of vision sets up the ulti and then when you get that zhonya's hourglass as well it's such a great disruption to the back line that's a great thing too right is he doesn't even need to be a big damage force in this game because of the champions around him he could just go for that second items on his buy more time in fights and just be this big cc and zoning tool for fbx galio has pretty much been exactly that in the past we also talked about rookies items earlier and how cheap they are it shows now it's where he is sitting on that that two item combo of the glp plus the twin shadow so he will be a lot of a nuisance for the enemy team we're at a very good point actually because ning has the umbrella glaive there's the black cleaver picked up as well and for ning he's going to be loving this black cleaver purchase from puff because that's going to be helping him i think ning right now who's been farming all game long by the way he's at a very good point 190 cs at 20 minutes as a jungler plus he's got a sizeable lead over tien's farm we do have dragon coming up in 27 seconds so ig of just hard committed five men to bot side to be able to guarantee this vision not have to wait out answer waves on the sides as we've seen fps have set up that top lane it is pushing into ig's turret the shy does have tp if he wanted to go answer that but instead realizing hey i don't want to have to dedicate that that cool dedicate that resource he's just going to walk straight to the dragon knowing the shot he'll take the fight and if ig win he'll keep me up there doomy also just finished his honors so now he does have that tool to buy time in these fights two items here for the gallery of ronan's hurricane for the ash as well we're hitting two items pretty much across the board bar a couple of key members remember infernal saw on the way ig already have two in their back pocket is fps start the position kim given on the flank balance knows he's there but it's taken tien gets the first dragon of the game in ig not keen on the fight yet but doom might be caught on out as the death grass doesn't pull in but there's the realm on to doom but he comes back in with the justice punch the shot as he comes on out here's the rest of igbo oh where the heck's that golden mate him he's done enough damages do me may lay her down with the two man ultimate but the pop blossom is on to four golden is rookie proto belt out no one's died yet but ig with a low health bar but do you think they can know bow land goes in while the rest of fbx have a great old time puff's dying too and bow land the re-engage was just so troll it was not nice to see but what was nice to see kim kun's flank coming in nice hex tech ultimatum to set up that nice alt from doing b they did get the members of ig about down to half hp but as you said uh balanced dredge line not exactly he had like one quarter of his health and i j you can see they were which is very easy but what is in hindsight is fbx with all those picks turning to the bearing and that baron is gonna get them such a good lead in this game 22 minutes in fpx with the comp that will outscale that will destroy towards this later game lyric very easy position right now for fpx a 5k gold lead time to stop pushing it goes back to what we said about how you look at ig's comp and it's very burst reliant right niko's burst champion graves is the burst champion sure ig has i mean the shy's itemized in a bit more way to get a bit more value of extended trades but once again mordekaiser wanting to burst out one of these party members for fbx but you're not going to burst out to mb he already is onions he has the taunt coming in as well the kindred lantern's fight that was a bit unfortunate was lwx's all missing because the shy went right into the death realm and the fbx members do get quite low i'm surprised they lasted so long nice old coming out from dim doom point lasagnas as well the knock up and there's the lamb just fight so none of that burst being able to take down the members of fpx this is where it looks a bit dicey balance flashes forward gets the hook but right there gimgun with the burst crisp able to follow up into envy as well just giving a really nice angle for tien to get in as well and do all that damage look at zombies damage though i mean easy engagement also saved his flash until the end for the almost three-man shield of duran fbx now in a bit of a tear with this baron as the shy still wants the 1v1 to give you but he's got the death dance now and that uppercut with the scissor leg hurts a lot hex that golda made him he says god kim goon better than khan just saying it in game one because right now he's dumpstering the shy and now they have baron i mean five before on the map they could easily take down the spotlight rookie is looking for something though but this is what we all said earlier on the epic's comp is just so mobile they're they're it's very easy for them to get away from any of ig's engages what do you do now i mean this looks pretty next i'm gonna say this to me looks like draft difference okay which i mean let's go back to lgd uh you know this is this isn't something new for ig no a lot of the time ig get away with murder it's quite literal but it's also funny enough to see a lot of ig's drafts i know a lot of people don't agree with it but you just kind of learn to accept them you learn to accept you embrace them and then then as i don't want to say coin flips but you know as you pray you just kind of hope it'll work out this game it didn't and i really want to go back to what much will said one more time that fbx had 18 days to repair for this fbx had so much time to watch all of playoffs they had enough time to watch rg of course ig also did have quite a bit of time but fpx especially with seeing how badly their style failed not only in playoffs but the regular split of course would go back to the drawing board tour if you're ig you could have a false sense of security and saying well you know we only lost one playoff match we didn't have a good read on draft we first picked list every game all these things so fpx had to dissect themselves and rebuild i just love that solar killer doom b kind of comes into the end but you give it to kim goon and yeah bit of a highlight in the bottom of your screen you can see kim goon is uh he's been rolling towards the end of the split you and i used the terminology duct tape for fpx so when i was checking their solo queues last night yeah i was so confused when i opened game games i thought oh maybe this is actually cons because his most played champions this week were jace camille irelia and silence is like the exact same as what we saw with khan now the one thing about elderberry's game is he's missed a lot as balance is caught out shouldn't be here depth charge used puff wants to heal his support but valen's dead for the second time and not a good start to ig because the shy's about to be solo killed once again the death rail means that he is sure to die question mark hook shot wall shot one more flashlight your big man the center kind of cheats the death brass comes in puff that's not fair i wanted to see that play out that would like both of them with a nice outplay the flash coming in from goon then the return flash coming in from the shy it was something of beauty until ning and puff got involved but either way this doesn't change the way i feel about fbx this game they're heading towards an infernal soul but do we even get there at this point it's just extra stats we have a 6k gold lead on the side of fpx i mean they're so fed right now they have all the gold on their main carries can i ask have you ever been in a league of legends game if they 1v1 me after getting angry that other people interjected i will not answer that question and i will you know look at this because we see the hexagon ended up coming out from dim goon now with the shy pulled into the death realm doesn't get the first q but it wasn't isolated it looked like so it actually didn't get a ton of damage so close to finishing off does flash that isolated q comes out with the w it was that's cheating man come on i'm not sure he would have won still but it was still cheating but that's the answer exactly yeah that was the best of two is what you're saying yeah we didn't get the answer we wanted oh well i'm sure we'll find out pretty soon at least for the shy even though the kill was taken away uh he survives he gets to keep farming up he keeps this i mean we're not gonna get the answer we want because kim goons also farming up kim goon is also picking up more infernal drakes but this game one has been so far what i least expected right ig who looked for options but have been pretty limited in where ningx paid attention to where the actions happened it hasn't been a very ig game the mpx have got to play this out slow we've seen ig succeed when they have either push or set up in top plus mid and you have like roaming and engaged champions coming out from ning and valham this game they had the losing bot lane so we didn't get to see balan move out of lane much of course the shy doesn't fare well in the 1v1 they don't fare too well in the 2v2 either but i mean dwight even always has to global the match if you're watching ftx not often do you see tien you know pay attention to top right no i mean no like that's why it's the shot he's like ah well i'm level two it's like it never happens no no no it will happen once every blue moon but to see them come into this first game draft with this comp hey it landed though kim good coming on in and balan now stuck in the middle heroes entrance going to lay it down and pups just dead bow land low the shy in the middle of it all with the death room to play with i'm good trying to take this one out he gets an up and go he gets a hook shot wall shot the shot is going to come out in the second and there they are waiting at least the shy gets kim goon collateral damage bit of damage on the excess as balan is not balanced rookie wants a flank fpx have the fast track to the base so they should be able to take this inhibitor baron's also up rookie still waiting for this one lyric 40 seconds on the show i mean rookie's half hp you have every member of fps hp because spectator's not right romero as the most annoying thing that still needs to be changed he runs away as boomby protobots awards of his tens over the wall bow land too far forward what's new as on to ning a bit of trading and there's the baron even with rookie being full hp i mean you're in a 3v5 against the comp that has absolutely everything up we have lambs fight for can they have more items they have more sustained damage they have more survivability tools i can understand though from ig's perspective because right this is where we always say you need to make the hail mary you need to you need to go for the like 20 80 play and hope that 20 percent land so you can get back in the game they always force the same play and i think a lot of ig fans out there know that if something doesn't work ig won't give up they'll try and try again until they lose the game i also feel like it's very comp dependence where if you do have a comp that gets hard outscaled that's when you go for the hail mary's it's flashing away from the enchanted sarah from ning facebook also helps bow land in the river but right now brookie might have to get out of there too but doomy just flanks on him with the tp wow rookie they know you're there we're going to get the yakity sacks as or the whole of fbx won him but decide against it baron thomas fpx making the smart decision saying hey why are we going to waste time and chase down another member of ig we can go to the bear and guess what ig potentially need to come into us or we just get a free bearing we're gonna have to contest this one but it's already gonna be gone but by the time they get there red swine connects onto doom the death realm still being weighed as the shy finally pulls it off puff comes in with adorning shadows the shy's in the middle of all this though while balance gets poked down here comes the mordekaiser and the lamb's respite from tian means doomby won't die the flay sends him up and doomed even picked up the kill 13-4 soon to be more with puff getting launched on this is a massacre and fbx they're done with their dinner they want dessert and it's great to see when doing b has been playing that the rookie-esque role and pretty much playing 1v9 in the summer split great to see this team step up as a whole awesome still going to be going four but that's the fake one they're ending the game yeah well i think this is over 10 minutes ago don't you maybe like 31 31 okay fair enough especially when kim good got ahead fbx i mean this is meant to be a regional qualifier and it felt like another day in the office yeah it was very literally another day in the office for ig for fbx though this was a really solid win again they've been on a bit of a losing streak they didn't look hot at all up against v5 where they lost three to one for v5 so coming in with this nice win it's gonna be nice to use that momentum and go forward for ig go back to the drawing board we need to remember that they came into this picking red side when we've seen pretty much every other team picking blue oh yeah it's also strange in the sense that we said hey fbx kind of the set band they need to have with dilution you could even say the same thing with the kalista and then you also have things like caitlyn coming out i feel like it would really restrict the the pools of fpx and you know not give them any flexibility if they were forced on the red side you know what we also saw as we saw that nautilus first pick come through to deny chris but chris gets his thresh which he's looked fantastic on in the past anyway so ig didn't really limit much of fpx and not at all no disrespect to chris but again i feel like ig did him a favor he looked absolutely great on this thresh he was constantly roaming around the map lwx he missed some ultimates but he hit some as well he put down the dps and he also consistently kept up the push in bot lane but the two people we need to highlight right kim goong and doing b doing be doing such a great job in these skirmishes and kim goon saying hey give me the camille have confidence in me believe in what i can do he delivered i loved also that we saw tien gank top side so early in the game put the shy behind as you said in game it's a sure-fire hit to put ig in harm's way like the shy being punished is how teams have beaten invictus gaming in the past we've also just seen fbx as shot calling as a whole just really come together like they finally heard game plan they played around all their priorities all their windows quite well they knew how to execute in these team fights and they were always objective focused right they knew we're gonna give up these early dragons and get gold on the map and we're not gonna chase rookie then we're gonna get the baron they always had their mind their eye set on the goal it's crazy to me that you know that was over in 36 minutes but did feel like again it was over very early into the game with how fbx comp went and how ig just couldn't find any options uh ning was farming very well but he never got into those fights where he could use it apart from the bottom side but from there balan engages doomby gets that three-man taunt and it's over anyway for the re-engage so that was game one and already i'm going well ig fans be worried my prediction's already wrong yep you said well you said three zero ig well i said three one to be fair this was a match that could have gone anyway we think this series could go anywhere two world champions 2018 2019 they're fighting for fourth seed at worlds and at this point fbx looked pretty

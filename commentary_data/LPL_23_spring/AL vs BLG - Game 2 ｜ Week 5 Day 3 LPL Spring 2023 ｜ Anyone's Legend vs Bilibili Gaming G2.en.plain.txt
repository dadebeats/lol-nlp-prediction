Nami most likely is well it is going to go towards the side of Al this time switching things up a little bit just expanding the champion pool letting elk get some more experience on the Zary which does have a zero percent win rate so I'm really surprised that they decided to opt into this side of the duo when Lucian Nami was obviously available uh when you're versing a lower tier and uh Team I think experimenting like this is good because you want to expand that champion pull and just get experience on it but sejuani they're pretty much just swapping team comps this time around but like I said xiaoha on these scaling Champions like the sejuani and this uh maokai I think he is such a inconsistent player when it does come to those early games where him locking in mouth is very dangerous because he often uh he often goes into these bad fights and he doesn't really get to the point where he's able to do a lot of damage on malka but of course the Top Lane bands are gonna come out where Ben has been looking extremely consistent even on the night he was causing a lot of damage in the previous game where he was pretty much following Betty on that 80 carry a way of the the game of a pretty you know it's like smurfing on the on like Golds and plaques and stuff like that I imagine it's just kind of like I don't really care what happens in this early stages I am just better that's just kind of how it is but now we come back into this one here it's interesting to see as hell with the shizwani band away or sorry picked by blg they're banning away the Renekton we do normally see the Renekton kind of used by the team that has the sejuani as a what was it a as more of a kind of an instant almost proc of your or your W for the sejuani but not gonna be given over not going to be taken either side by blg is a Al now start to focus out towards Bin's champion pool didn't go for the few or last game but could definitely go towards this if uh if a allowed it to go through so now we might see I was gonna say a Camille bandaway here because I do not want to give those big melee top laners in the jungle yeah sejuani just looking for them synergies in that top side for the side of the LG this time around but with the captain being taken off for blj I'm expecting a rise which does get locked in for yagal where he is able to scale safely into the game which like once again they are completely flipping the teen comps for this game too and this is just blg saying we can do it but better than you guys anything we could we continue to do we can do better and honestly this is a flip this is the flip there's a straight flip right now I I would need to see a Gnar I don't expect to see a blind Gnar coming in here but I would love this go for an hour and let the other team go for casante this would just be maximum disrespect if plg did that yep I'm expecting a Naran casante matchup in that Top Lane again I mean sound is still on the tables and we have been seeing a lot of success when it does come to this Top Lane matchup which is getting holded by Al I believe it has a nine or ten to one win ratio in the LPL so this is a very Giga Chad blind from the side of blg but bin isn't going to opt into the casante pick because we know that San does do a little bit better when it comes to the 1v1 and what does bin have in his little champion pool because he is very experimental when it comes to the variety of Champions he has I love that his little Champion pools yeah I was gonna say you you saw your little and you just went no oh he's so small well yeah look yeah gonna be the Gnar Yep this time around we have a huge switch up in at least the Top Lane match of San gets introduced into this game too and a lot of thoughts from the side of Al with the maokai all available of course paired with the Scion the team fights are going to be a lot more easier to execute and of course Jay is going to be in the hands of Penzey this time around I think Jace when you're up against a rise he does naturally get Lane party so it's gonna be a lot easier for y'all to make these early plays around the map especially also having the Lucian and Nami in your pockets and we're gonna beat you with it yeah I mean this time of elk is on this area and we need to remind our fellow friends and family back at home that the entire reason game one went so terribly for the side of ALS because Betty on the Zary made a little bit of a mistake in the Laney phase where he was just getting killed over and over where the Lucian got out of control so now that elf is piloting this Zary Champion he you know it really depends on how he plays the early game and if he's going to get cold out and make the same mistakes because I think ale needs to play towards that absolutely I do like the way we see the sports going back because they picked up 60 goals between the two of them getting some nice Frost uh some stealthy sorry I was gonna say Frost Fang and I was like I think that's gone anymore I am I am old I I remember when deathfire grass was in the game okay well it's like I was also a death fire grasping drawer but this time around in this bottom of 2v2 I have spotted a rune different a lot of different Rune coming out of the Yumi I believe sold out went Guardian last game but this time or on has decided to go with the Aries so they're just Giga chatting it up in this bottom 2v2 yeah they really really are just trying to just put down the pressure right now I will say yes the luchadami is exceptionally powerful but we did see it in game number one the Zary and the Umi Jewels just have a better time at level one you know kind of the stages you don't really gain that power for the Lucian Nami until you get that full pilot of you know qw and E even obviously the r as well but this is kind of another bonus we will see a bit of a trade into the mid lane as you go just kind of putting wow pinsey wow that's a that's a hell of a trade there coming up from a rides and only one rotation of spells yeah that was a beautiful trade from Yaga traditionally the J should be winning the lane but I guess just giving the rise to someone like Yago if he was the midlander of jdg for four years he is going to happily take this 1v1 duel and take those trades where pinsey gets chunked out but this time around the maokai does comfortably uh scale or well he is Comfortably taking his camps around the map uh but I do want to see Shin going for those invades at that red buff because you have the red buff available when it comes to those 1V ones yeah well a bit of a all in there in the mid lane there's a yeah we're just trying to put down the hurt early on to this Jace does have a little bit of priority with the wave clear for the moment until Jace gets a couple of levels but there we go you can see 12 wins to 19 in the all-time in the LPL 2023 summer splits and uh this uh sorry summer spring splits too much it's just too I'm going between too many different things right now we loved you on the LEC and you know just kick back and relax and enjoy this Al verse blg match because we see students going in for that second red buff from the side of shell Hall so the maokai once again getting bullied out of his own jungle camps where xiaohal knew this and he was just trying to look for a play on the other side of the map but of course it didn't work out too well so once again the sejuan is going to hit six very very early compared to the maokai where he is one Camp behind now but how is he gonna utilize this power level 6 Spike when it comes to these early game picks wait to see Sean will get his first blue buff so good for him uh changing over the first game win I will say you actually got to see an early back coming out for the side of blg they went back a couple of coals so recognizing that this Lane isn't going to be a uh a kill Fest for the moment just kind of recognizing they could get a little bit of an advantage should uh all things go the way they think they will been taking a trade against CDC and again going to be wet noodles in this top side PVE for the longest of times they are just not really in a position to try and fight each other but Betty starting to get rolling a little bit now on this solution starting to feel a bit more comfortable like I said once he gets those three uh points once again till three levels having access to his full kit makes him much more deadly but speaking of deadly gotta be very careful I don't really expect you to go for a fight here and I say that you do get the the healing from Sword Art they get the burn but yeah I was gonna say you don't really have any oh it's gonna say CC but you cannot walk forward there Sean burning The Flash oh Betty that's pretty big shooting out here saying I got one more and mean he goes into the cute and buns Betty's flash but like he said elk getting this call early on into the game Ultra disrespect into a Lucian Nami Lane where they have so much kilter into you in these early levels but you know having Betty not having that flash available once again uh I believe Shin is just gonna consistently look towards the spot side because this Top Lane Smooths first but the song does have a comet for this second game and that does help in terms of trading when it comes to the rangerverse melee matchup nicely done there by Sean the kind of repo pressure on this is a thing as well like you're missing Summoners down the spot side it's a difficult thing to really make work for you as we see the Yumi trashing on that's getting a couple more gold to make sure she can get her uh fairy charm alongside that amplifying tone so nice little recall there for the Yumi and the zeri but again there's more and more pressure coming out here on top of Al they need to try and find a little bit of an Avenue I will say that we'll be hitting level sixes very soon onto the likes of zdz and pin Z so curious to see if they can make a move blg they're already kind of ahead of the play right now and they're already on the Dragon yeah but looking at the item cells we have the noon quiver available full Betty and zarya only sitting on a long sword and calls so just the pure damage difference when it does end up in a 4v4 in this bottom side it's not looking too hard for blg however they do secure the first dragon when it is the very Yumi uh getting the lane priority and the first round goes towards the scaling composition so that's pretty worrying because you want to have things happening for the side of Al I'm gonna wait to see where anything kind of goes right now and I will be as you say we always talk about it you can say it we'll say it a million times more we've said it a million times before gale force Imperial mandate that is the spike we're looking at right now and even alongside something like uh the Jays yeah it's uh it's uh it's a pretty step box standard one we are waiting for the meta to kind of change over here in the LPL once we get onto the new patch hopefully soon uh but it is going to be about that kind of setup right now we're just waiting for that to really happen no one's really in a position to make something work at the moment but I set it up Sean thinking about trying to see the girl for something here it's not level six I really do feel especially if you're trying to make bot Lane work without a melee all in support you are gonna have to try and just get your ultimate to really set that one up for you and your team yeah and Betty does have the cleanse available so the first link won't work unless you do come and re-gank as the sejuani he is going to just focus on clearing his camps and get that level six Spike where he is able to force these plays a lot easier as the piggy of this game but of course xiaohal not having his early red buff available to him he is a little bit more behind compared to sejuani so if Shin is smart enough about this and he tries to force an angle in the mid 2v2 while Malachi isn't six yeah I lie Malachi hit six first well xiaoho vice versa you should be looking for a player now while student is still trying to look for that level six that's what he is looking for right now they will drop down a war but hasn't been spotted just yet they don't know the maokai is here on needs to be careful the kitten is caught and declawed he's gonna be killed off no problem whatsoever I love the Zary just went all right I'm out but the Nami took it I'ma be real on most senses that isn't the best thing in the world but gets you to Imperial Monday quicker so maybe it's all right I guess that's kill secured for you uh plg is going to respond with this hell going over towards shin and if Al wants to force this 1v2 embol in I think it's doable because you have delusional available uh but they're just gonna back off here and take the one for zero trade I didn't uh blg didn't expect malfai to be level six so fast because of course your own channel was a little five you kind of expect them to hit it around the same time so onwards just a little bit greedy with stepping up as a lonely kitten and he does get spotted from the bot Lane of Al and the Flash they'll be coming out of maokai just gets it secured you me having not having the W available anymore it just goes to a free kill this is a pretty free kill you should just give it to Betty but sorta going into the sneaky W and does get that for himself isn't terrible enchant is getting kills early not too bad uh because you do have the Imperial mandate win condition when it comes to that mid game yeah look we'll call it calculated for now and stop people from getting mad but uh it is it is of course the kill there in mid lane while we were talking about that we could come back into live and start a flash being burned there by the Jace of a l so nice start to having that uh ultimate available to Sean because he makes a little bit of a move for himself Top Lane we see Ben looking to try and get his first plate of the game and again I'm I'm not saying it's the exact same as game number one but it's feeling very similar regardless of who's on what Champion it feels like we are uh having a bit of a loop a bit of a break in the uh in the in the Matrix right now as it's uh almost identical to what we saw in game number one this time around though it is just blg on those big scaling picks and kind of just happy to survive as we mentioned earlier in the in the first game yeah I mean Ben does have the Gnar once again in his pockets elk he's just gonna eat out and get out of trouble here with the Yumi trying to sustain back that poke but now Shin having his uh open he can't get it and the maokai just happens to be in the right place at the right time he does have his ultimate available to him but he is in the bounce house right now he is getting pushed about will knock back xiaohau and with the blast cone there keeps himself alive Sword Art does have flash but isn't gonna bother using it because he knows he's dead Betty gets hit by the ruined prison blg we thought it was going to be topside but the solo bolo it was bot Lane with the four-man stack I mean Xiao comes in clutch with the ultimate and save zdz from dying in a 1v1 up against bin but unfortunately ales Ballin wishes too overextended when you don't have the maokai hovering you this time around and they get engaged on and uh they fall as a zero four two all the plates going towards the side of blg once again with this Herald being dropped as well yet way too overextended from the bot Lane of Al this time again where shun Dodges the vision nicely and just gets and engage onto Betty where he is in and engages it first but of course once you're eating you can't really out even with the flash available it just wasn't enough with Yaga rotating as well so these leads you definitely don't want to be giving to a scaling composition but once again the balling of Al just providing all these angles for a scaling composition to really get their items online and I will say the credit he almost killed off elk really very close to getting that kill there and look it doesn't change what would have happened after the fact but still decent to try and go for that one here speaking of going for something we are going to see Al moving towards this Dragon they're actually going to move zdc down here as well to try and fully commit to a 5v4 if they can Sean not really in a position to contest this one here so it's just like like an Al stopping the stacking early making sure they do not give up anything more than they need to and there's not going to be a super early soul for blg yeah it's not too bad for the side of field you already had that first initial dragon in your pockets and of course the zero picking up four plates in that bot Lane towel three plates uh you don't really have to over Force especially when you want to be having a safe early game up against such a strong mid-game team composition coming out of Al this time around good decision making from the side of blg you just have to keep this up until the risen's area gets their items online I don't think Al can really handle that later on into the game and that's the big thing as well is that I think it was smart from Al they recognized look we have the Gale for us we can move the Scion down he's not really going to be able to do much against the Nara regardless so no real loss there from a couple of minions so happy to try and stop that stacking and kind of commit to that one as well we will see no flash remember here on this Jason he's well aware of it because he is playing nicely behind his uh where his vision line was so he knows that there's no one in the spot side at least in the river and left before they're giving him vision and uh yeah we're gonna go back to kind of just farming back seeing these boat these coals being finished up we only have one more minion there for the zerry before she gets hers and uh that's where we're gonna see the immortal Shield Ball come out and we're really gonna need to see a big movement you would imagine as well could show how say hi but they were both puppet sweepers he's got himself his WB should be just fine they know that as well they do not want to overstep their Mark and get themselves caught out just in case someone else was sneaking around the corner yep elf was looking a little bit frisky with the way he was causing towards that try Bush but uh he smelt a tree from a malawian good thing that he decided to back off I mean this Spotlight is looking relatively well although Betty and soda has picked up their mythics at 13 minutes into the game I think if Betty uh sorry if elf plays with small with his Bara and of course the Yumi having all Summoners available they shouldn't dye the initial engage where Al is trying to force something in this bowling 4b4 as ryz of course picking up the roll but with the ninja Tabby as well he just isn't going to offer as much all nuts isn't gonna offer as much but uh the Imperial mandate was hit and immediately smacked down that was a very big amount of bursts to come out there on that bot side and uh yeah this is just Sean having another great game 100 kill participation right now on the sejuani and I I mean I'm saying that we're seeing the same compositions just reversed but plg are making this stuff look so much more clean comparatively to Al in game one yeah I mean getting that pickle until soda once again just a 2v3 in the bottom side johal tries death really to Zone the bot side of uh blg saving the tower but like he said ocean having an early or team comp where you have the Jace and Lucian in your pockets this time but losing the early game is going to be so detrimental when it does uh come to those items getting online for the side of elk so Xiao please try and do something here because you're currently sitting on 1kb yeah you're on 1kp I bet it's 100 KP In fairness to him gotta give him his due but uh it is uh not really a lot you could do this area is just gonna play so so safe even without the Umi available to her she knows that I could just get over a wall there's no real kind of threat on me unless you can get that hard CC and it is kind of one of those moments where especially in the newest on the newest competitive patch of 13.1 B which we haven't jumped on to yet it's why this is one has just been far more value than that assorted oh you flashed a little bit too early the W comes in the Final Chapter and the kill goes over that's l two zero and two Sean has been setting up his entire team so damn well and they are just reaping the rewards here on blg Pusheen Sora is just so out of temper compared to the jungle and ADC of Al where he is just being left behind as they reset into base and he's just kind of wandering into the hands of shin and once again the kill goes over to Elk two zero and two now having 100 KP onto the Zary picking up the bot Lane tier one Tower as well so what I just giving blg these opportunities to scale much easier into the game but it's just getting out of Al's control already I'm gonna make something happen they gotta make something happen right now as they Al they need to try and sort themselves out because they are just falling too far behind this Rift out will be a good start but 5 000 or four and a half thousand gold already at 60 minutes into the game and you're on a scaling composition as vlg you have the rise the Zary you have the things that will move into canoeing monsters in those late game but Al they are struggling to try and keep Pace right now they are gonna be pretty much equal in terms of items right as coming in towards that mid game that you know also on game number one for blg should be having the power yeah I mean you weren't able to kill elk when you had the gale force advantage and I believe xerious was sitting on her noon quiver but now with the baron model shilbo in her Pockets this time around with a little kitten attached to her at all times it's gonna look so hard unless pinsey lands these amazing cues onto the carries of blg before you engage your 5v5 thing is as well you you've got yes you have engaged on the side of Al but it's very situational engage it's not as easy as a ultimate coming out here from Sean it's not as you know point and click as a ruined prison with the rise it is very much like you need to have the Scion hit his ultimate or get a knock up there with the decimating smash you need to have the title wave hit someone alongside the the maokai ultimate which can be avoided so these are definitely moments here for Al to try and think about what they can try and do but while that's happening plg are thinking about what they are doing which is taking the dragon and getting themselves back up to stacking up that Soul yeah most definitely and my eyes aren't just on shell house um flash because obviously like you said there's not enough uh 100 cc coming out of Al but you know when you do have the flash route available on this maokai pick and the Zary still doesn't have that cleanser McHale's online well it's gonna be a very easy pick for the side available a lot of follow-up especially with the gale force in lucian's hands as well so I would love to see that happen before we hit you know the Fourth Dragon where two of them already gone to the side of blg the scaling team competition has been picking up these early dragons where you're giving them the dragon soul Winkle which is a mountain saw on something like a rise uh azeri who already has a Yumi for all that uh support and extra little setups was definitely not ideal uh coming in here for Al they need to go for something and that's the thing look I have no problem with a team that wants to just kind of go crazy go a little bit aggressive make something happen and you know you go down swinging you go on a blaze of glory to lose to kind of you know just the same thing over and over or you're just not really changing anything it does feel like you're missing a trick something is happening for blg are responding and kind and saying we're not gonna allow anything to happen but they might try and go for a fight here here we go They're gonna try to get the Scion in on top of the Zary but not really working out they will get the second turret those that's two turrets but CDC moves forward the Final Chapter not reading a great position does four CDC over the wall Sean very very low flash Away by xiaohau keeps him safe away from the mega Gnar bin is gonna be able to try and get on top of the other top laner as Sean does fall Al trying to force blg in about and Jay's do too much damage and that is the mid game Power Al needed to leverage blg playing it so safely until the 19 minute Mark where all the kills go towards the side of the Al and they just revive from the game State I mean like I was saying I think Al they forgot that they're playing the strong uh team composition this time around they were still playing like scaling but with the ultimate getting dropped from xiaoha and of course the Fallout from zdz they get two towers and all the kills where it just kind of brought them back into the game and just repeat this because they don't have the items online for the side of blg just quite yet so this is going to be your way to victory for this game too we see soon going in for a flank but of course the second tier Tower does go down from the sound ultimate but this fight which is played so messily from the side of blg everyone's just focusing down soon really good uh Target it from Al where the front line dies instantly of course bins now ultimate misses as well really big shame for this team uh body but look at Penzey flashing and eating onto the carries of blg where it was just such a big burst of damage and dlg wasn't ready for that where elk dies in the middle of the wall and just the way pinsey played this team fight was so patient at exactly what we need for ale to get back to this game yeah a little bit of life in them great to see and honestly you know as you said it felt like blg were kind of maybe disrespecting their opponents a little bit there you're not playing the the mid game composition you're not the one with the power right now yes you can burn someone down I'm not discounting the damage that comes out from something like a Gnar arise or zeri but if I was to pick between the two I think Al definitely have a lot more of the tank so really nicely done there for the side of Bale they are still behind about 2 000 gold but they're in a much better position than they were a few minutes ago yeah I mean like we've seen the straights pick two games in a row very impressive when it does get to the 20 minute Mark with his two items available like the manamune eclipse once this Jace does get land his cues onto the carrots of blg it's just gonna look really tough unless he gets to really sustain back up but the LG taking over the entire top side with this vision control where your face checking into sejiwani and Nar uh although Nara is still split pushing but I believe once it does get to the 5v5 stage Ben you know I believe in you you can land those ultimates again I mean even if he doesn't I just looked at the Cs he has a 70 CS lead over his opponent he is nearly flame horizoning he has a 350 gold bounty on him kill Bounty because of his farm he has no other things on top of him that is ridiculous coming out here from Ben but CDC has been soaking it up has been doing well enough to keep himself relevant and like you said he's just a giant meat wall to try and be a nuisance and an Engaged tool for the side of a l but 35 seconds till the dragon spawns now Kitty as we come in the LG haven't got control over this River just yet but they do have a war they know on the side of Al that that Ward is there but we'll see if there's rainy anything to come out of this there are still plenty of Sonos available no flash on Betty though that's the big thing I'm looking at here yeah I mean the beauty of playing sound is once you get that Jack shirt and of course the second item online just way too tanky so it doesn't matter that you're suddenly see us down but blg trying to just dodge the sound or Dodge the initial engage available yeah we're gonna see a little bit of a fight on both fronts both junglers using their ultimates but they're gonna get the mega Nar now off in flashes away he does not want to lose his perfect KDA of zero zero zero no one's died just yet elk is kind of peppering down the damage but the Scion's still very very healthy no one has died but the dragon is still on the pitch the big thing for blg though is they're gonna lose the mega Gnar with the Mega Knight down the sejuani all not available for this team fight it does look like it's going towards the side of Al for this second Earth Dragon but pinzy he has a really good angle to get the cues online he does miss the first one but if he gets the Q and the Poke onto the Carries On plg yeah they're looking to try and bring down zdz that black lever doing work right now just burning him down so so much you can see Ben already nearly has his meganard back available and everyone's starting to reset Kitty we're still in the same fight this is still the same Dragon neither team has lost anyone but they are seeing some things being burned now Betty has his flashback and everyone across the board should have their Summoners available looks like we were all just kind of a gentleman's agreement to get it before this fight but the major difference is that bin is Megan are once again so they have the engagement to really opt into a winning fight after this dragon soul Point goes over to the wards the side of blg with the sun and malkile not being available for this fight they're gonna go look for the band because they don't have another option and look that was just an unfortunate time you did have TPS available for blg they got bin back they got rise back but there is a war in the back of this pit with Zion now joining this is risky but they'll melt this one right now this could be this could be the baron flip of the game shin has a Smite available so I don't know about the 50 50 flip here we go they're looking for the fight back once Ben takes a huge chunk out of him sean gets caught out a little bit himself as well tries to flash away gets the heel outer on gets the car on his back but it's not enough to keep him Alive Now ETL are feeling confident L trying to get up don't everybody flashes while the maokai was still moving and that means he falls down Ben trying to build Mega once more it's on to him he looks for something but he gets hit by the Bramble Smash and he cannot land it under the carry finally he tries to get a kill but on says thank you very much that one's mine and now everyone from Al is running away it looks so good at the start but now the Gnar the Yumi and the rise are just putting in work you go moving forward trying to see if you can catch out some of these low health bars and Al recognize they're not safe in those brushes they're smelling Betty but he gets out safely after a really terrible tray from the side of it I mean I could see what they were trying to do they were trying to turn with the Jace poke and of course the sejuani falls down first from the side of blg but this Nar and Rise is way too fed already with the level Advantage both level 15 and like I said zerry is also becoming online and she was actually able to challenge solution throughout this entire fight but look at Penzey he was just trying really hard to land the Poke onto blg by Yumi enters the fight very late where a student kind of just Falls straight away and the biggest Point here is that xiaoha lands a flash W onto elk and secures that kill as well but Yago untouched this entire fight and he just comes in with the flank and shreds everyone down because he is that level 15 rides with the two items available and Ben is unkillable with the Yumi attached yeah the the double yordle combination uh definitely I actually I think I don't think actually at Yumi is the order but ayal crime yeah Nara is I don't think Yumi is but maybe we'll talk about this a little bit later as we got ourselves a little bit of a fight there we can see the sejuani goes in they just need to keep her alive or keep her away from the baron and they secure it but now can you get out alive remember you used a hell of a lot of Summoners in that last fight so you won't have them available to you Sean still walking forward still looking for something else pushing forward the flash from pingsy goes keep him alive four now he has to move backwards to not get caught up with the Final Chapter but you know he's gonna go down he's not gonna be able to trade back elk in this particular exchange but important for the rest of Al they get out with four Barons Al just getting so desperate and forcing a baron the second time in a row but this time blg just weren't able to react fast enough because they were resetting from the previous player and it does go into the hands with ale so it does revive them from the current game state where it looked terrible as the rise and Gnar of course are online but with Penzey dying as a a return for full Baron Buffs I would gladly take that but you need to remember that this dragon is spawning in two minutes so you still have that to worry about for the side of Al so you need to force something to happen with these Barrel minions Before Time Runs Out so there's no vision for the side of the blg this time so they just sneak it or ale just forces it and just I don't think blg expected it to melt this quickly so they were very slow with the rotation especially sejuani still getting her Scuttle crap it was spotted on a ward but they reacted very slow and this gets shredded and you shouldn't going in just head first but he gets caught very similar to what happened in that first Baron fight and he go well he was pretty low but of course with the baron going into this hands of Ale they were trying to force a fight only getting pimsy although one kill it's not worth for the baron I tend to agree fairly close in the goal as well nearby a thousand not really that much of a difference one minute till dragon soul that would be for blg but Al will have the baron for a little bit more after the spawn of the Dragon so they should have priority over man and bought you would imagine there's only been two two hours taken here on the entire map by the side of ALG Two Towers in total by both teams you know kind of get four uh two apart available he's looking for something he's thinking about it but it would be very risky to get the maokai ultimate out of him now Ben taking a fair choker damage onto him won't get hit by the maokai ultimate just on the back side of that one there so he's gonna get started up here by the you me as they try and maybe look for a re-engage no meganar at the moment because he's gonna lose it just the last second the Final Chapter keeps zdz in place but it does not kill him off both top laner is now taking a brunt of the damage here from both of these sides but neither dying as they just become the big meat walls they need to be for their teams a lot of ultimates being traded in this Midway but of course the baron men just have so much presence when you are trying to fight for that mid lane priority but Nara has a really nasty angle right now so he's able to get mega Gnar for this dragon soul blg is looking in a very good position there are indeed you go has TP Sean almost takes a shock class I could have killed him there but he goes forward but he's feeling it they're trying to make this one work they do have a barrier to be used and the heel lots of Summoners bring you an Al finding a bit of momentum Al finding themselves in a little bit of a situation where they are able to take these fights this Scion is so hard to kill in these situations that it feels like blg need to have yeah he's gonna get himself there blue buff secured the dragon has been started yeah he is half HP because he didn't actually go back he just he peed down towards that both side so not able to regen right now zdc getting knocked down by these black Khalifa procs reducing his armor as Ben goes into Mega he's got the car on his back and he's looking for something more the Final Chapter comes back again as the immortal Shiba was hopped to go wait until the 50 50 but Dragon reset not quite that he's dead and now you can search over the dragon but look at Elsa just free hitting on the back side there's a fight here for the side of Al as they do shred everybody it's elk with the cat as he moves forward looking for a little bit more elf trying to make this one work we've seen this one before but he's not quite able to make it happen it's Dragon secured three for two trade in favor of Al really good Target selection from ald decided to just focus down soon while he was alone in the dragon pin and of course he dies before the dragon drops below 1K HP and they didn't need to flip the 50 50 dragon soul but a elk just sitting across the wall tossing out so much damage I believe yalel just didn't space correctly in that team fight where he fell straight away but of course this Dragon was just getting focused down for the side of the LG because this was the dragon soul point but elk untouched on the other side of the wall however they just don't have enough damage to get rid of the sun I mean sun is currently what 90 win rate in the LPL this Champion once you scale into the late game once you get the baron buff available and he gets those items online it's gonna be really tough for even Yago to shred through him in these team fights yeah you can see how much this top laner was just dealing right now and even in the in the enraged Dead zombie form he almost took down elk at the very last breath but that does put the dragon soul now off for a little bit and gives an extra couple of resistances remember those resistances will stack the later the game goes on and for someone like a Scion that is pretty significant but now Betty he's in a lot of trouble if he gets caught they're gonna try and keep him alive the cleanse is good the Final Chapter though keeps zdz in place he is again still so very tanky Ben looking for something not gonna find it though whatever it was and now blg they need to be careful Flash in there's no Tower there anymore and you go with the lifeline for the sales keeps him alive pinsey trying to do something here onto the back side but Ben almost gets the Mega Knight down but zdz has been left all on his loan he will be kept alive only to die goes into the enraged zombie but will end up falling 30 seconds or a little bit less till the baron spawns and it looks like belgia finally found themselves back in this game all right roshin it's currently 32 minutes into the game zerry has three items online rice just picked up his void stuff it is getting to that point where the scaling composition is taking over these team fights and of course you saw how fast Hall died in that team fight elk just melted through him and without the jungle available blg is just gonna take this band for free and once they do have these empowered minions to push mid and top I'm afraid these team Fighters is looking so suffocating for Al so I think that's the best way you can put it suffocating is the word because it's just gonna be so much coming at you from so many sides it's gonna be nigh impossible to be able to confirm it there is the baron for blg they'll have that right up until the next dragon spawn and as he said is having that priority having that pressure around the map is going to be huge but again we can look at the replay here uh pinzy you're not quite sure we're looking at him but I guess you're just gonna say recognizing Al saying look we maybe go a little bit overextended but it looked like they could have turned it around yeah I mean like you said the two on Tower was down and I believe shahal did get a really nasty flash route onto Yago but yago's flash was just in time where he flashed into the safety of elk and the sejuani where he didn't die as a response and of course zerry once he has the ultimate available and the sound doesn't have his to run away the series just gonna pop off and you can't outrun Azaria with Yumi no you you cannot outrun this area Yumi it's just not really impossible and the great thing is as well for blg is that all they lost in that last fight was one flash that was your guys flash at the start of the fight where's our look on the other side of it you've lost our house flash you lost ping Z's flash you lost Sword Art Splash you lost a lot of Summoners that may not be available for this fight if blg take it for you know the dragon once it spawns but looks like they're gonna try and push in towards these side Lanes use that meganar as a deterrent for the Scion he's got himself the force of nature as well so he's doing very very well for himself but again more and more pressure more and more gold coming in and again like I said suffocating our Al who had an opportunity they got this composition they got a token from blg from game one it looked like they may have found out how powerful it was but you can see now with the later the game goes on 34 minutes now coming up on the clock this team is just so difficult and even just the varieties but it's three items he's so tanky yeah I mean Al like the song Can't Even match up against his Nar anymore so that Jace is forced to go to the Side Lane but without this Chase poking down the enemy team before it fights uh pursues I'm afraid that ale just doesn't really have a angle to win these teams by Thiago as the support available he does but no flash and yes he's tanky but he's not gonna be that tanky against four members of Al and now without your rise you gotta be very careful Sean needs to make sure he stays alive there's 20 seconds till the dragon spawns this area is doing well though to put in work babe coming in off the flank as well has got the mega Gnar available to him doesn't use it just yet uses the Cato show hell because he's the jungler you've lost your top laner You've Lost Your jump there you've lost your front line elk still pushing forward needs to be wary though as DDT chases him down but they could end the game right here right now look at Alex helper he is so tall but is it enough for them to really rest the game because you are in such a sticky situation elk is completely online pinsay you gotta start Landing those cues before this Zary just pops up in these team fights I mean with the Double Mountain dragons in the hands of blg he just has so many defensive runes and now the dragon soul is once again being threatened to go go for Betty instead he dashes forward he's got a cleanse he's got to flash his Zone Betty to help play he flashes forward trying to get into Elk elk is dead you do not have any more damage than that was blg fight and they're looking for the TP they're gonna get your Gail back in on top of this fight does have the realm or but he's gonna look for the dragon instead I mean even with elk falling down Yago is full health and he is just TP to this fight so it blg really need a shred this Dragon down before this zdz no Smite no smile on show him he hasn't got it yet he doesn't have Smite they can't take this right now they don't want to flip it because they know the maokai is coming this is a 3v5 effectively at the moment you're gonna see nice side step of cdc's open at the time jump on the pin Z who goes forward and gets himself into zanya stasis TP coming in from Ben this is gonna be all the way from Al they're looking for it Sean is dead they don't have a jungler that Baron or for me the dragon's still going is it gonna look for this one here the rebel Inferno Betty gets killed on this team fight it started in mid lane at the Inhibitors still going it's literally as thin versus the world even though he shouldn't dies but him coming in with the clutch TP and by the last second he just saves the entire fight and I believe this final Dragon does go towards the side of vlg now that xiaoha has been executed the other is just gonna shred this thing and the dragon mountain dragon soul is going to towards the side of a very tanky rise and zerry who have all those Health items and this will be the dragon confirmed here for the side of plg get themselves the soul it took a while but again this was great play from Al they kind of said look we can do this we have Summoners on Betty and they just focus out elk yeah I mean Betty had a really nice e dodging this initial sejuani invade uh engage and of course there he fought as a response of that uh Yaga is getting a bit impatient here by forcing the dragon when it is still a 50 50 flip especially having numbers disadvantages he does keep you into the fight but what in like about five seconds I believe Ben is going to come through with his teepee and Yago is just constantly being zoned out by this song because he just doesn't have enough damage to kill him but you know who does bin does and he comes in quest gets the megana from the zero percent of the bar and he just kills everyone with the Yumi attached and this is so Scrappy from plg as well I gotta say Al just utilizing a lot of their power kind of hiding out these fights very very well but it's just not a nope it does feel like every now and again they almost have an opportunity to bring this back they almost find the perfect fight because again don't forget these death timers are getting very very long they are just not reading the position where if you lose two or three members you're down for 40 plus seconds now at a point so you need to be very aware that what you're taking is the correct fight for you and your team I mean your wincom was playing through the Jace poke but with the mountain soul in the hands of blg look at that damage it's not doing anything belly shredding through the uh Shield that mountain Soul gives here we go we're gonna see Ben trying to move forward here on the pinsies anything very low bin doesn't go down just yet though if blocked by the Yumi nicely done there by on to make sure that the Gnar did not fall down waiting for those Mountain Soul Shields to come back Bayern will be up in seven seconds so now we're gonna see a little bit of a separation here now for blg they need to make sure Ben does not die I mentioned earlier the long death timers if you're not careful in the AL they're not done yet Kitty they are still pushing forward they're still confident enough in their ability to make this one work they know that blg bin doesn't have that TP available so if you want to look for a force while Ben is still so chunked out barely getting uh any heals from the Yumi can force right here they can force it they haven't gotten a reset out of Bin just yet he will start to go back just now and that's you're gonna wait a little bit longer hasn't got the human on his back baby oh there he goes I couldn't see the animation on the mini map so but guess himself three seconds himself back onto the map not gonna fully research us yet as uh this mid lane this game has now devolved kitty it's an Aram it is a it is an all made all random all the time because it is about that fire and buffer feels like it's not gonna be the game Ender just yet but it can lead to some pretty decent setup's been very very close to Mega we'll have it available to him they know that everyone's kind of retreating out right now as Sean moves forward everyone's starting to get a little bit testy a little bit and seize it's a little bit of a weird story Ben's looking for something they know he's there though and they're putting down some serious damage to get the maokai ultimate out of shower how they go far but he only catches them out nobody gets stunted he doesn't catch out Betty Auto Ben is dead now it's onto your gamble I'm on to Elk it's very separated from blg they just didn't really put themselves in the right position and Al pounce and get themselves The Kills ocean now with Al picking up this win with this composition a second game in a row I'm pretty sure they can just end with a 2v5 for the side of blg this area just can't really survive the amount of damage that ale still has in them but this we'll find out Al team composition maybe it is just a better team con maybe here we go we're gonna go forward here they're gonna get themselves the Final Chapter into the ga so already Azari has died once the Yumi will die and this area will die again so they tried their best they did take down the maokai but these death timers are just too long we're going to game three Kitty Al had themselves the compositions they felt that it was the better of the two and they are proving now the two games the Lucian Army has been proven Supreme you know what ocean you said that it's looking like an Aaron but I'm pretty sure we saw an Aaron for 40 minutes of this game too because we just saw constant fighting but no one was dying and that was getting really concerning but of course with that game-winning of game turning play in the mid lane where they were able to get so many kills onto the Jace and Lucian they were just able to snowball and of course sneaking in that Baron later on into the game just helped him in so many scenarios I think in that last team fight specifically Ben got a bit impatient although he landed a really nasty four-man ultimate everyone on the side of blg disengaged and they left so Nar altered in turn back into mininara and just died instantly where the communication definitely was an issue for that last scene fire and honestly it is great for Al to get this win back of course that looked like early on in the game they weren't going to be able to do it it was actually kills going over the side of blg but I like that you brought it up it impatience had a little bit of frustration from blg that's kind of been the call from this squad pretty much the whole split we are only five this is their sixth Series in terms of the split but it has been impatience that's been really you know cursing them throughout the split it's really been screwing them over because it just feels like if they just wait for the moment that they find themselves you know someone who overextends just be patient with it they should find an opportunity and a couple of times they just didn't and they got caught out yeah they got caught out and even with elk not playing those team fights extremely patient but I think this time we can credit pinsey I think his JS was extremely uh potent in this game we've seen Jay's very potent two games in a row actually so I'm really wondering if you want to opt into this rise verse uh Jace matchup when even in the late game I believe the rise wasn't doing too much damage to specifically the silent pick which is constantly on your face and Yago just didn't look like he had the best time in those team fights so of course game two sample size it just seems like this team comp is the better out of the two yeah it does feel like uh wow blg really did not uh get themselves the advantages are they got themselves the advantages to not make them into anything more tangible and that's with a mountain Soul as well so it just feels like right now this this Lucian Nami combination 54 000 damage throughout the game and even you know the Jace as well just having the Imperial Monday to be able to buff off these 280 carries effectively is just so valuable in the LPL it just feels like it's either gonna be bad you have to ban it away or you got to do something about it try and get it confirmed for yourself because I don't I don't think we're gonna be seeing the same bands or the same picks coming into game number three I feel like there is gonna be a slight change because if you go if it basically becomes whoever gets Lucian at me basically controls the game there's just no way right and like you said although Betty did the most damage in that game this was not a perfect early game coming from the side of Al we saw that Betty and sword art were just constantly getting caught out but in the very end with the dragon soul going towards blg they were just able to poke them out from just pure range working alongside the chase where eyes as that short-range Mage Champion you just really aren't able to respond in terms of damage and it's all up to Elk in these team fights and of course elk when you have a malka in the enemy team constantly flash they'll be onto rooting you on the spot it's gonna be really tough to play oh absolutely and again he almost turned it around a couple of times but it did again feel like especially in that last fight around that mid lane that it was just very disconnected you know two people were going in three people were going backwards it did feel a bit weird for blg and Al rightfully so took full advantage of it so we're gonna send it to a break when we return we're gonna have our

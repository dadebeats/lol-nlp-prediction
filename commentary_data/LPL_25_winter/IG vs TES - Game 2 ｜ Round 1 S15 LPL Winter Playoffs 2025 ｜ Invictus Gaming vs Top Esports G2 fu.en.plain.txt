in the first split of the Season he's done a great job of being able to adapt his notable and signature melee and assassin play into being able to pick up those control Mages and he's done a great job so far and one of the things that you mentioned rude is that kavi and cre need to continue finding these Champion Duo combos that work well together nocturn Oriana is one of the first ones that popped in my mind okay we'll have to see whether or not one of those gets banned away typically it's nocturn that you take away uh and then that sort of alleviates the duo IG Banning conon here suggest they want an ambassa the Shai had an incredible ambassa game uh in the last series that they got to play uh so wouldn't be surprised to see that taken as first pick here again is a champion that we very infrequently see uh get let through multiple games of these Fearless drafts uh top though back on red side now uh with that rise ban could be looking for a bit more again of that slippery style Champion uh just getting rid of the room prison thank you yeah you called it man I mean the fact that there's no uh answer to the abessa that would have been much more difficult in either the Cante or the Renekton they go for that first pick and now to top orts they've got you know access to a couple more Champions that maybe not necessarily as threatening as the ambessa in terms of just overall mobility and disruption to the backline but I mean Jace has been such a signature staple especially on that tank build shout out to flandre who has now caused the terror of all of our games with you know full Dam damage Jace going to the Wayside and now it's either at least Bruiser Jace or tank Jace where this guy still puts out a decent amount of damage over an extended period of time and he's just too damn tanky to deal with yeah I think fortunately we've turned into uh more Bruiser style jaes in recent patches but that is a nly locked in for at least the second series I've been commentating in the playoffs it's another nly game plenty of Mages here to match the pace of inaly so Zyra still open uh which you know typically notable goto lilia's also up there but maybe just want some hard CC Lilia is the one that gets taken for J so we're going to be looking to match pace for pace and again so far this time round it's a lot of these H check style Champions we're looking at maker we're looking at crisp to be those facilitators this game the varus gets locked in for gas was hoping for a little earlier on but for Tops specifically you mentioned that they struggled when it's crisp being those engages locking in NY canavi means it has to be crisp yep well they could try and lock down something like the Nautilus or the Leona for chrisp that guarantees that point and kit stun so that the spears can land with no fault whatsoever unless kavi misses it but kavi is a notable n player like shun and Canyon across the world so I have no doubts that this guy can pull off the cougar Queen herself as we head into the second round of bans poppy a nice Champion to ban away as even though more than likely this ambessa is going over to the shy they could Flex it around get a little crazy send the ambessa mid lane give poppy over to the Top Lane or even support for moo and it's just a good tool to try and deny any of the Champions that want to dive forward to have Mobility steadfast prence puts a stop to that yeah KY a must ban here for IG already top have picked themselves up a very decent poke composition with Jason nidle on their own uh taking the Cory out of that equation as well fits your brief quite nicely it's also nice that they've taken the virus away uh by extension because that removes the idea of poke varus as well now for IG right you're looking at what other AD carries they might want to try and Target it is those targeted range maybe kaisa gets taken off the board if they're really scared of some potential all in with kais Leona as well uh top Esports though taking out those supports taking out naus taking out poppy is's a little bit of that disengage and one of those answers also to the Leona in lane and they took away the misfortune so if they want a strong laner for jackula JY is the best answer and even though JY doesn't offer nearly the same amount of poke that ays does he offers utility and setup and all at the benefit of being long range so that he can safely throw out deadly flourishes open up with a curtain call and the rest of his team can force the fight on their own terms we've seen Jacky Love play Jin before and we've seen Jackie Love play Jin against IG before again these two teams played against each other in the Maria cup the winning game had Jackie love on Jan where he curves a fourth bullet around two different people and snipy out to take them to that game Victory IG though they respond they've gone for the Braum a notable answer to the Leona and also going to be very solid for trying to block some of this poke coming through into that mid game again my concern for IG similar to what I had from game number one is that they've now also drafted themselves this relatively poke oriented composition and like the air to be paired with the varus because it means they can double down on the poke it allows for now poke varus to come through Lilia bowling balls might not seem like it but they are also an incredibly obnoxious form of poke as well so that gives the chance now for IG to play this longrange style and I think for both of these teams they are looking to play with those ranges and top and supports for both teams feel maybe not a lot of out of place for top Esports but especially for IG who's diving with the Shai this game and besser is going to go public execute somebody and then the rest of the team are just going to be POV watching seeing if they can get anything you know to try and help out with but it's going to be a real struggle for the Shai this game I'm worried for yeah I didn't mention it before when JJ locked in Lilia but if you lock in ailia that early then the the other enemy composition wants to draft immediately long range damage Champions that can space themselves because Lilia thrives when it's a bunch of melee Champions that she can easily proc her abilities and continue sustaining herself while you know dealing percentage HP damage across the the throughout the extended team fight this is not going to be one of those cases this is going to be ailia that might be forced to just you know send herself in with a Q flash Q flash Al engage and just pray that the rest of her team in IG can follow up and finish off the rest of the top Esports here because the rest of top Esports as you called out I mean there's so much ways that you can control the fight and prevent the rest of IG or at least make them struggle try and get those entres in and again uh an elimination series for these two teams going into game number two now where we've got honestly relatively similar compositions of a lot of poke a lot of range on either side could very well come down to execution and when you've just lost game number one again this IG organization uh completely changing the script for 2025 splashing out on a super roster that was expected to make waves not just in theas cup but in the LPL as well have fallen at the first hurdle of the massia cup have now fallen as well a little bit in the group stage where they find themselves as a lower bracket team now they're going to have to try and Claw their way back from a series against top Esports situation that they were unsuccessful in in previous times or risk failing and risk going out very early for IG the second game running off not necessarily on the best foot here as Mo's going to get his recall cancelled by a good spear from kavi Top orts managing to bully their way into the red quadrant of ig's own jungle I'm curious to see how kavi wants to start this out they've already put down some defensive WS on their own red quadrant suspecting that IG obviously they don't want to see the full quadrant jungle for free they want to be able to get a quadrant back on their own terms as well and but they're going to have full vision of it whereas IG they have little information of where can is going to path after these camps yeah and at least now they know that kavi is starting on the bot side I mean they probably suspect this anyway is once again we get to see this 2v2 in the mid lane this is uh the same sort of vibe that we got from game number one where we' split the map uh this time around though it is just a little bit different with uh where the junglers are starting both of them now starting on this invade uh and I think that for top orts them being able to at least play this Lane out as as best as they you know well I say as best as they can as best as canavi allows them uh by throwing some Spears over the wall uh if they can get just the same sort of game up that they had in game number one canavi is just sitting in this Raptor brush I mean this 2v2 as well it's double range yeah and crean 369 able to hit level two I mean normally we talk about level two power spikes for bot Lane Duos but the fact that we're in a world where we see mid lane and Top Lane Duos battling out in the mid lane and already just using that Advantage now the shy is going to try to Advance forward but immediately 369 sends down the hammer and the shy thinks otherwise before he wants to continue fighting that one I think this is this is now a good timer for IG to try and remove this sort of two versus two uh getting that little trade back onto cream is actually really beneficial keeps rookie at least even enough in HP we're saying that crisp or cream rather has got those biscuits in his inventory so going to have a little bit more sustain there than rookie one thing I will say about the NY Lilia matchup is that it's nice as the NY to try and disrupt lilia's uh early farm rotation because she does have a fairly fast clear speed despite not being as strong as a skirmisher n is and if you don't really do anything as a n within the first 10 15 minutes while you're ramping up to that first item Spike and you don't get a huge Advantage off of it then the Lilia takes over the Lilia becomes a much more threatening team fight presence now that being said we already talked about draft wise that's going to be really difficult going into the composition the top Esports have drafted now there's a Teleport and I believe it's 369 trying to pick up the wave The Flash tries to guarantee the auto attack for the concussive blows but these turret shots are ramping up fast but not fast enough that's first blood for IG okay and I mean maybe just expecting that Cris would be there a little bit sooner and wasn't as now J finds himself mid lane canav is ready to respond and actually Chris is here oh no J I thought cream was in trouble but kabi was off screen and Chris was there for the rotation and he even takes a spear to the face as he tries to flash away so flash burned from the lilan not the biggest deal but upon level six is going to certainly mean that uh we remove some of the playmaking capabilities and now for the Shai a very solid Advantage might not have been able to pick up the kill but has a wave that's about to bounce back into him he's already ahead in experience should be able to control how this lane ends up going and with the bot laners now returning to that bot side the split map has been uh called off could very well cost canavi or a couple of his camps is uh in fact deciding to go for an invade himself but they're going to turn on to Mak and they know that he doesn't have Flash from before since he made that dive happened and Jacky love steps up to make it happen JJ also in trouble remember this Lilia also doesn't have Flash but they try to look for the CC but kavi didn't quite have a spear available cream rotates in gets some chip damage but no threat to the rest of IG yeah quickly done and you know top orts they played on this spot side the whole time they've got that laying down Vision they've got the cursory information on where they can cannot step and igig didn't have prior down on that bot side it's Jackie love and crisp able to move in first finish off that kill pick up a quick little pickup granted it's only on to makeo but we're saying that golden jacko's pocket is always gold well spent and picks up the Swifty boots so be able to keep himself nice and safe now versus this varus bro Lane that as we' ticked over to level four now for both of them might have a little bit of a say in the one two versus two and they currently have pryo at least on the B side of the map to start up this dragon and it's well before grub spawning in the next 30 seconds so they'll have time to at least get a chance to reset or maybe walk on over but as I say that Jack love and Chris spawned on Vision they're going to spot that the dragon is being started up but there is a Smite to secure it now the question is do topy Sports want to try and pick off a member but they just can't get there in time fortunately nothing that they could do as top orts there to stop the Drake from going down and as well for for top orts right this is still an elimination game for them as well as much as you know I I have them down as favorites to take this series in game number one sort of adds uh to that as well um they're an organization that want greater success this year and and that doesn't start from in the doesn't start in a lower bracket first of all it's a a failing on their part to have lost out on that position to begin with but getting through Swiss stage yeah but then they immediately get zero3 out in the quarterfinals of Worlds this is their first chance to get back into the Limelight and if they you know can turn themselves back to going up to first start finding a bit of a uh success in the LPL in 2025 split one to begin with is how they write those wrongs but they also have to correct their narrative both of these teams one of which will go home have got a lot to be uh correcting from last year and from the start of this year as well yeah and whether the correcting comes through successful matches and series throughout the low bracket or if it comes in when they return in the second split you know only time we tell is top orts maybe cre is in a little trouble he has Flash and so we'll definitely use it to get over the wall safe for now no other tools that IG can use to try and punish while he's checking the river but IG are able to net themselves a crab here and I want to go back to kind of the expectations that you were setting up rude for both of these teams I mean we have to remember that both of these rosters were set up kind of as not necessarily you know big roster Shuffle but IG and and you already pointed out that this is the first time that they went for a super team formula they had mostly been known for being super Developmental and trying to bring up players through their own LDL teams before trying to give them a chance to play on the main stage they said nope we're bringing back rookie in the shy we're going to pull in J and then see if moo and Gala can work out together and so far obviously we've seen the inconsistencies and where the ceiling could be but obviously they have so much to climb whereas for top Esports not quite the same story as top eorts has been Fielding formidable rosters for years now but it's just a shuffle of you know one Superstar jungle in tenen going over to kavi who made such a legacy for himself on jdg but not able to find you know a world championship which he was so close to with jdg in 2023 yeah I mean that was the the the the roster that should have been should have golden roaded and wasn't quite able to make it happen right and canavi as well especially for this player in particular making the move to top Esports and seeing his team do so well right Tian or rather with jdg as well just playing out of their minds re recently you know yes they they came out as having shake their way through the group stage they still were top seed they've still won their upper bracket match and you know that that jdg roster now without kavi is thriving and that's a a real point of kav's contention where you'd like to think he's kind of got to to step up as well and prove that he's the one who should be coming out better of these trades and I think on the flip side as well there was so much talk for JJ about being stuck in EDG jail for the last couple of years where he was just this player that was oh by far in ways the best player was stuck with pieces that he could never have expected to win with well this split he's been G been given to former world champions and if that again isn't enough if that failing still comes through the questions start to have to turn into well is it just a piece of you know is J the problem or is it that actually these pieces of former world champions aren't good enough yeah I mean he's even reunited with his support that he won a World Championship with in 2021 on EDG so you know if this formula isn't good enough then what else is going to make it work for IG now obviously this series is only one game in still plenty of time for IG to at least for their fans hopefully get it right or figure it out well enough that they can triumph over toport despite the one game deficit that they are experiencing dialing back in then to this second game uh the group spawning on that top side in about 15 seconds we can already see some decent moves from supports up to that top side uh worth noting that crisp is here first so that cursory Vision will be favored for top orts to begin with but Drake spawns in 20 seconds as well opportunity for a trade on both sides if they'd like three grubs already the way of top Esports first dragon already the way of IG so we'll get to see where our teams value their priority what they're looking at and again to remind people the expectations for this game is that we get into these five versus fives we're going to be seeing a lot of poke both of these compositions have a magnificent amount of range and then that sort of piece that's outling from that really feels like the shy I think that IG probably going to struggle a little more as we get to 5 v5s if they don't have a little bit of a lead that investa dives forward doesn't have the support of the rest of the team oh first grub J is able to secure for themselves so they at least deny the six grub nightmare scenario but Chris fanes himself an engage on to make JJ tags him and Chris was now forced to escape rookie looks for Jackie love he had flash but he didn't use it he had both Summoner spells but he still goes down top Esports now without their adk can't really challenge unless cream can equalize it but the spirling despair doesn't finish off moo the Shai is cut off from being able to collapse with the rest of his team but he's still safe enough to walk away from the fight so a big Inn for IG here on this top side going to be three grubs picked up for them and they can maybe even look to recall it's a 50/50 for who can make their way to the Drake sooner everybody backing on this top side and nobody particularly has the vision to say that they can start it up in their own right and you know this goes both ways yes if the Shai goes forward he's going to be isolated it's the same to be said for crisp he jumps in nobody else can really follow up and you quite rightly highlight jackula here has flash has cleanse but as soon as he gets scooped burning either one of them is pointless and you know Wise of him to hold on to it in that case but should have been flashing that wall if he wants to keep himself alive maybe just saying that he can give the three grubs but values his Summoner spell for a little bit later on or and what's maybe more likely is just just misplaying it's definitely not the first time that we've seen it from Jackie love this split so far I mean we we talked about this guy world champion with IG back in 2018 and it still has been one of the best ad carries we've had in the LPL for many many years that being said the group stage play that Jacky love has put on has not been super shining of the ceiling that we have seen from this guy over his career and so if you're a jacula fan and a top orts fan altogether you really want this guy to to lock in you know mhm and already right that highlight of IG game one that we had had pointed out Gala is two and zero on the varus the gold is in the right place for this Invictus gaming Squad who In fairness he has opted to go into the on hit this game so Blade the r King rage blade expected to be the next item as canavi and JJ but heads down on this spot side looking to try and take First brick down in this spot Lane the second dragon of the game did go to top careful this turn hasn't been taken quite yet they're just doing what they can to bully off IG from defending it and with the last bit of the proc there of these plates top Esports will net themselves first Tower of the game while rookie is collecting plates for himself on the top side of the map full resets coming through on that bot side now for top Harold's going to spawn in the next couple of minutes so again transitioning their coverage over to that top side would like to try and take that down looking at feets of strength first brick uh taken by top but we're still up for the feet of warfare still up for those feet of objectives as well so whichever team gets that Herald secures the objective one and one more kill for IG will find Warfare toop be lining it out to the top side with these Camp plants able to find so much move speed as well able to defend the tier one turet on this top side but you can see already just every team or both of these teams I should say nowhere the play is going to be made mhm and for top orts on the bottom side I think it was a little bit lucky for them that they did not allow Jed to get in range to force an engage where JJ was one of the few people on the map that had a first item Spike along and tops scrambling their compon but now tops LeAndre SFS and collector all fully completed for all four of their damage dealers here topy sport is definitely feeling a little bit better about taking a fight at this point in the game small advantages for rookie and Gala but they're not amounting to you know those big overall item leads worth saying that I do think that finishing off the archangels uh gives him a little bit of a weaker one itm Spike than we see for rookie who's already finished off the he's combat power certainly I think favored to ig for the time being H and that probably doesn't lead into anything other than a fight around the rift Herold then maybe we get to see a bit of a trade down on that b side if uh you know ID IG or top think that they're not particularly in a position to try to take that fight but again right if this is a game that IG find themselves losing out on they're now staring down a match point and going 20 down again for the second time this year against top Esports or at least the second time with this roster may have been the back end of 2024 but even still it's a worrying Trend that they weren't able to find a single game in their Deasia cup rematch that so far they haven't been able to push the envelope in this series and in this game especially they've had this small advantage of having gala this gold but haven't been able to do too much with it this Herald spawning in 5 seconds time is going to be that big indicator is that where IG look to find the fight look to leverage this advantage that they have and really unleash Gala yeah well Gala thankfully for him is relatively safe with both Flash and cleanse available the only really ranged engage is that crisp Leona ultimate as they're now hunting moo he's got a shield so he's able to deflect and absorb a lot of that poke damage but Toy Sports doing a good job of bulling out IG away from the river as they look for the heral summon a heal used in exchange for the solar flare from crisp so that ranged engage for crisp Now not available will have to sacrifice his body if he wants to get in TP from the shy is far but it's bullied top Esports away here IG have wrestled back control over the river and not without control of the mid lane IG now the ones to start this up but top won't give this for free 5K still on the rift hero top e Sports got to be careful about the shy looming over there's a control Ward that has full vision of this Mesa trying to make that flank happen and it's enough that top e sports are not going to even try for the rift Herald contest IG are able to C for themselves it's great angles from IG even though they don't actually find a fight the Shai comes in from one side gas just threatening with that little bit of poke from the other as well down on the bottom side of that ramp and top Esports know that if they go too far forward they're just going to get collapsed they don't have enough of a front line or enough engage to withstand that level of a collapse coming through and IG find themselves that Rift Herald now so the combat for the objectives going their way he going to be the feet of warfare weirdly enough that decides who ends up getting those Feats of Strength there rookie now starting to feel a little bit more confident stepping up to cre yeah cre was trying to teleport to the bottom side of the map since IG had burned a Teleport of their own to make the rift Terell play cre was trying to set up Priority to get uh pryo for this upcoming dragon that just spawned and the rest of IG ready to collapse onto cream so that forc 369 own teleport just to make sure that his mid laner was not left out dry cuz Chris was not going to be enough defend his mid laner from getting absolutely punked on yeah and I do think there is an element right now of IG just recognizing that they've got slightly better items and top Esports may be recognizing the same Herald down in the mid lane not just to force pryo in here but also to put a decent chunk down onto that tier one turret Drake is the overall goal for both of these two teams and now it's bot Lane pryo for top Esports so that better Angle now generated for 369 on this Jace with the grasp so not as much poke but he's given that up to try and join and reconnect with his s and IG once again with just enough control and enough bargaining chips in the early game to find themselves at least purchase on this second objective it's pretty difficult for topy sports to the wrestle their way into the river as they look for the engage crisp and Jack love immediately flash away solar flare looks for rookie he flashes that as well a lot of sumoner spells already burned off of multiple ultimates being expended there's the fear on the J and now they pounce is gone good night Bambi that's the cougar sinking the their FS into the deer and now top eorts looking for the collapse more onto IG they're being able to hold it back now but moo could be in trouble using the stand behind me to jump to the safety of IG but top e Sports even though they don't get any much more off of IG members they now have control of the Dragon yeah so again feat of warfare still the thing that's up in the air two to two for both of these two teams the objective going to go the way of top Esports they'll find themselves that second dragon and it's off the back really of One Quick Pick and it's off the back of cream once again this all starts because he finds a fear yes there's this you know uh element of engage for both of these two teams before I love that rookie holds the shuffle expecting Jackie to flash that PTSD of the fight around the herald from the third second grub spawn but cream lands a fear which sinks up with a fear into a deadly flourish and we get to see the range of this composition one part of CC lands the rest of top orts collapse immediately mhm you see the break out fight top Esports we're definitely looking to bite off a little bit more but it's so hard to fight your way through a Brum once The Shield is up and he causes a lot of disruption with the glacial fissure as well so good on IG to not lead even more after the open wound the JJ being caught out caused for the rest of that team but top Esports managing to pick up the Third Dragon of the game puts them two away from soulle point and this is once again rude I don't know how we managed to get this but another Chemex soul for ourselves in this series yeah so again not the most highly sought after soul but certainly one that teams will be looking to fight for all the same I think the the reduction of damage you get below a certain threshold certainly something that was uh looked out for in the past Sobe we'll get to see some of that hangover into this Soul as well for the most part though we return to this uh almost uh stale mid game where we're seeing these two teams just jockey for position and the tension in this game really beginning to build that you know one of these team fights could really swing the pendulum one way or the other and neither side has really taken firm control and I think it's really important that the IG take this game in particular I mean there's an element of oh well you know you do you want to take every game make it 3-0 would an adore but I think going down O2 uh just just really struggle uh as far as that goes and the the mental pressure that puts on you to be able to perform three games in a row up against the team that you've already fell against so far and the idea that top orts would just Thro their way through this will be playing in their minds and continue to sweep them it definitely feels like this game has been building up a lot of Tinder and just waiting for the right Catalyst to catch fire and really blow this game wide open because there's been you know gold bounties that have been building up for both Gala and kavi respectively and IG might try and just bust this open if they try and pull top orts into a disadvantageous scenario funneling in through that Corridor on this Aon now is the time for the Poke to happen right cream Jackie love canavi 369 they've all got tools to poke people out IG has stood standing on an objective fortunately it's in the lane they've got a lot of space to work with IG have started this but they're going to be tanking they're going to be reducing resists and top should look for a fight less than 4,000 the shyest spot at 369 immediately marks him oh good on rookie find shakula but no one can really follow up the glacial fishop finds the knock up but he cleanses the slow and the rest of top East fors they just Barrel on forward praying that it's enough to win them the fight Jacka Falls but kavi sinks his fang but the Aon was secured by IG so it's just ga's being popped here fake death for the side of IG and they're going to look to see at how many more kills they can get the shy is not able to find anymore in top Esports they didn't get the Aon but it definitely feels more of a big win for top Esports yeah it's a bad sign for IG they were able to to find two kills off the back of that which is their Saving Grace and they don't technically give over any kills but that's still 1,000 gold that top picked up in those fake death kills remember they give 200 gold now as opposed to the 100 a little bit of missed Synergy here rookie shuffles One Way Gara not able to follow up with the chain of corruption and yes he goes golden in the back here but rookie doesn't have anything left in the tank just starts walking forward as soon as he comes out of stasis while the rest of his team are getting absolutely Torn to Pieces and again Gara doing what he can in these team fights but he's been pounced on and collapsed his front line left him for dead and there was nothing left for this IG side top Come Away with a big fight win and whilst they don't have the objective they'll be able to find themselves at least an element of hope that they are in the advantage now with that fight wi going their way yeah it really seems like the Aon just deflated what could have been game breaking for top eorts but it's still not a great state to be in because it's still an even one and IG were really hoping that off of the secure of that objective it could have given them the key the leverage to really just snowball this game wide open because we talked about before hang on 369 should be fine doesn't have Flash though if rookie wants to send it for the shuffle yes he will the Shai connects as well and 369 doesn't have enough movement speed but he's got the heal from kabi to bail him out I mean this guy is super taking and thanks to n she's pretty much a support at this stage of the game if he can't Len the spears but you know God bless RTO we're giving in Le got heal support heal Buffs baby and now top Esports are in a better spot to be able to contend for this Dragon since 369 still has a Teleport so if so if this is secured it's soulle point for top teleport from 369 going to be used to get back into this fight and again we look to the Poke we look to the range advantage that top orts have in this game where they can use qu pooke they can use Spears over the wall and they can use the flourishes the Poke from the Jace as well flash by Cream Dodges the public execution that's one less ultimate that IG have it would really be down to G to find a chain of Corruptions onto a key Target but meanwhile this entire time 369 had the midwave pushed in and says I mean if they're going to fret about whether they want to step up for the dragon or not I'm just going to take their towers no and now they've escorted 369 out of mid lane by you know shepherding IG the long way through their Jungle Top playing that little sequence much much better and IG again they don't have the same ability to contest at range and their engage is solely the shy he went for a fight there tried to find cream but he f f or found his flash was able to get out to safety and from there there's nothing really that IG can do again it's another game where this draft it it's it's a lot more difficult to try and execute on maybe if they'd have had you know a poke Baris in here they can look to contest that poke but on hit you're really looking to save your spells as resets blight proen uh to to Really find the damage through that means as well now going to certainly struggle I like the idea that he's building toward this blood thirster as a third item he's going to need it versus all the Poke that's coming through but that then creates this situation where Yaris is the one who has to stand up and be the front line because he's the only one who can actually take the Poke the Shai doesn't really want to absorb it nor does jer or rookie and moo level nine on this bom he's going to get ripped to shreds if he tanks more than two Spears he can only press lock it once you know and after that he's got no other tools really deflect projectiles and bursts once The Shield is down and so for the top rest of top orts they find themselves sliding further and further into that Advantage State you know the gold lead is not really the story it's just oh I like this though IG they're getting ready to ball top eorts know that the baron has been started up kavi no flash 3,000 HP canavi one spear it is SEC and Chris is in there but K has a great angle on this top lift flank Mako is the first one that falls the jackula but the rest of IG if they can survive this is a great Baron secure but the curtain call and the Searing bolts are trying to find their targets in their mark one last curtain call bullet hits rookie in the face he's forced to flash GAA can't escape the deadly floor snipe from Over the Top Jackie love the sniper for top Esports and IG with that tournament series on the line here finding a way to keep this game as even as possible A Rush of the baron that Nets them this objective and getting out with three people and importantly your two s side laners but more can be found it's still going Chris sends it once again the Shai still has a public execution he wants to look for a re-engage but he's not going to chance it because he's taken too much damage all from the back of top e Sports carries so I love this for IG yes they lose out on Galla and they lose out on moo and granted double Summoners for the varus being lost feels pretty rough as well but I would love to see now a one through1 setup for IG keep Mo or keep J in the mid Lan as there was a Teleport down to this bot Side by rookie he wants this tier one turret they've got a chance now with this Baron to really put a dent in that gold lead going to try to take as many structures as they can with this push there's no teleport from I lied 369 and cream have teleports if they want to answer on the bottom side of the map but they're just going to take the long walk as 369 answers towards the top side of the map going to get a chance to look at that replay once again it was just such a fast bear from IG massive respect and you know that's the power that having onhit varus and a gives is that they could have got through that Baron and did so to get out J able to run his way out to safety and Gala uh you know sort of left a little bit to the Wolves you can see rookie thinking about do I need to defend him do I not but he catches one for or one shot too many Benz hits flash to get out to safety and you know in the long run could have probably just left Gara to die and accepted that they'd have got out either way but now that question of where do IG look to leverage this Baron they've got one tier one so far if that wasn't just a a Hail Mary to keep them El in the game and they actually wanted to make something of this Baron they've only really got a wave or so to do it and looking at where those waves are positioned on the map they're going to need to do it on this timer or or not at all and you can see with how deep mids getting pushed they don't really have the opportunity to do that feels like this Baron was just that uh stop the damage stop the bleeding uh but that that you know again when you were so even in gold in the first place speaks to how far they actually truly felt behind yeah I mean Baron buff is about the time out in the next 20 seconds and they didn't even go positive you know let a low break even with this Baron buff like they were hoping to and it's it's so difficult to try and do that when you make a Hail Mary play like that and then just try to bum rush the heck out of there before top Esports can punish any stragglers which obviously we saw in the replay that they did and top Esports still taking their time in just pulling apart IG as they continue setting up Vision Line once again for what should be their soul in the next 30 seconds there the solar flare connects on the Jed jet but no commit from Top Esports that's the beauty of solar flare you throw it out and see what happens and if it's not good look then you know you don't go on it yeah but that's now a big ultimate that's still rank one and won't be available for the stake fight uh really good unbreakable as well from Mako so any skill shots that did come through would have been protected as you can see J sweeps out several deadly uh of those traps that we've seen Jackie ly placing for the the last couple of minutes Soul now spawned and once again top orts how good's your poke can you land those skill shots canavi 369 eyes on you to set up the HP to weaken IG so that you can find this dragon and honestly rude it might not even come down to the Poke but just the traps because with it's com down to the Poke well okay you know it it didn't fit my narrative in that moment but you know well that's cuz they were missing that's cuz they were missing the Trap the Poke and The Traps all combined they're going to do their work on the as they're slowly losing Health on these bars Jed J looping around the bottom side looking for an angle flash onto couple members 4,000 HP on the dragon the fight is stalled out public execution falls on cream he's the target but he flashes away but the Shai has the mobility to be able to tag him down the cream Falls but kavi secures for the rest of top Esports rookie is down the rest of top Esports they can fend off for themselves without cre but the shot this is the Highlight moment this is the time to make up for IG being able to come back back at this game and Chris is still on the Run kavi throws out a spear is able to get vision for now and gives an escape path he's going to take his chance to get the shot I don't if that was wise enough but he's got the heal he's got the blast cone he's going to hop skip jump away and this kavi is just one slippery cat yeah and that's a win for top eorts even though the fight doesn't go great even though they lose all three of their carries they've got double TP for crean 369 they've now got so on all of their carries as well and they should just be able to take fights in advantage from here on in J with a great flank starts off this fight with a double sleep unfortunately doesn't quite catch canavi this sets up for the Shai to find cre and find cream does he is the way gets absolutely minced there's nothing for him to do there but then jackula Autos a PL instead of moo because he dips into the bush so he has to choose now with his final remaining bullet who am I actually going for decides the better Target in taking out the azir but Baron spawns in about 30 seconds time here offer and remember top Esports have just secured the themselves a combat Soul so even though the gold is dead even they've now got all the power that these dragons are giving them that little bit of extra movement speed three chem Tech Dres as well stacked up and big note there's no flashes on Jackie love or cream so for IG if there's any hope left in the upcoming fight over this objective it's the fact that the two main carries for top Esports are that much easier to lock down and try and find I'm looking at rookie I'm looking at J and the Shai to be able to coordinate their ultimates and really punish the fact that top orts backline is down without their escape tools and rookie has a real opportunity here to reconsolidate himself as one of those players as you know has had so much Legacy in the LPL as being one of our top midlaners he's got flash he sees two immobile backliners who don't have flash this is an opportunity for him to go big and keep IG from going down to match point to going down to tournament point and getting the themselves knocked out of this game H Sports take their time and pushing out the midwave before eventually moving their forces into the river teleport from 369 trying to cut off the shot he has no flash he would have to look for a public execution angle but he's got the mobility deadly flourish does not connect rookie waiting for his moment trying to see if Jackie love steps too far forward Kem good enough for top orts not right on top of Jackie love just to separate and make sure that they're not too close little bit of stut on the frame as Mo gets caught by the deadly flour there's a spiring despair this just could be the IG support going down for free the rest of top ESP Sports Now find themselves in a five on four and IG is seemingly a little more difficult to try and find this fight Chris who good flash by G but now I don't even think cleans is quite up yet so he has to be careful when he steps up again so topper going to start this Baron I think in the face of rookie and the shy both of which still have ulti especially in a pit versus AIA rookie can huge deadle flourish connects on the rookie he's in trouble he pops the St still has a flash if he needs to get alive he starts to flash in he was done momentarily the three- man Shuffle is it going to be enough for top Esports but they have the ga for Jackie love to survive and cream is still full HP chain of Corruptions two man tag with the Ling lull but no up cuz IG they're pushing through but just not enough strength and confidence to be able to push through the river to punish every single member of top Esports only 369 fell kavi looks for the take down the N combo that's it baby kavi one of the best n players in the world finds his moment to snipe out Gala and now top eorts looking to run down another straggler in the shy solar flare connects deadly flourish Falls up it's beautiful moo tries to bail out his top laner once again sping despair connects on to Moo the Shai still taking more damage but Mako has done his job and bails out the shy canavi flashes onto Gala and they start to tear the house of IG down Brick by Brick taking the fight onto the shy afterwards taking the fight to Moo has to summon a heel to get out to safety but importantly ig's job was to stop top from getting the baron and they do exactly that moo gets caught out and dies that's a 5v4 that they should be looking to win canavi though here it cannot be understated the power that this player brings to this Champion you said it yourself Mark late game n isn't an enchanter when have you ever seen an enchanter Flash and one shot a level 16 virus one beautiful thing about nidy as hold rookie still no flash the Shai is going to block these Curtain Call bullets and make sure that rookie isn't completely isolated even though NY definitely more of a support kitten in the later stages of the game and more powerful on the heels this is still a champion that if you find a spear if you find a trap onto any squishy member and they are hunted you deal so much damage you are still an assassin as nly if you can find the enhanced pounce and the Empower take down and now top sports find themselves in a position the stard in the baron as well JJ tries to get Vision with that swirling seed deadly Flur connects onto moo the Shai trying to force his way in but the baron has been stopped for now crisp looking he's driving forward for an engage zeni blade goes wide doesn't want to commit that solar flare and this is where the power of ig's range solar flare does he have flash he has the stasis to buy some time kavi pounces back rookie looks for Jackie love kavi is caught but he pounces over the wall to safety again and rookie the shuffle not quite ideal for IG to save this game and he goes down loting Little J is going to try to save the game Jack love is still running away he's totally fine and the shy is not go gets hit by the fear the cleans it's not enough kabi and the cream we're going to carry this one through but J is still alive and he's ramping up on Lilia this is the late game fantasy that Lilia can achieve and it's enough for top Esports to feel threatened away from the river this is what a super team can do IG once again have no right to win that fight it goes so wrong to begin with but this time it's Jer it's the Shai that step up in the back half to take down Jackie to take down 369 and make sure that this fight this game remains as even as it has been for 37 minutes canavi still deathless on this NY but man then this fight looked so damn close for both teams here R we got to watch that again it looks doomed IG shuffling rookie jackula flashes out so the azir is doing nothing during this team fight we're seeing cream get down so many passive procs all of his damage is going relatively well but J flashes in forces cleanse out of Jack love here stasis out of cream who gets immediately you know soloed out focused down after the back of this but it's the swirl seeds coming through it's that chip damage from Jer that finds enough and that makes sure that this fight again this game is still just as close as it has been God what a banger 38 minutes of just high octane such tense action between both of these teams cuz you have to remember objectives as well this is tournament this is potentially tournament point if IG lose this game and topy sports up two Z is not a state that you want to be as an IG whereas for top e Sports netting this game puts them at such high confidence High morale to have the security of knowing it's just one more game after this win and Chris looking for that solar flare does not connect onto rookie IG starting up the Elder Dragon the rest of topy sports have to find their way into the river now but members of IG starting to get split up and the elders nowhere near close to getting burned down the curtain call is starting to scatter IG across a lot of damage on the G that fourth bullet clipped him and he's now down below 75% HP topy Sports now have a freeway in they're committing towards the front 369 marking the shy on the back rookie got three man Shuffle once again J connects with the combo Jackie love cleans up go before he goes down but cream is completely isolated and found out kavi it's up to you and 369 to carry out this fight he goes back in the pounce looking for the taked down once again J still trying to kite this one out good stun by moo trying to buy as much time for Jed but 369 sends it to the skies with a hammer and Jed has to give ground kavian 369 triumphant in the river fight another fight and another Banger between these two teams only one kill to separate them canari starting up the Elder here J hasn't got flash but he's going to get enough HP jungle privilege is a beautiful thing two versus one now Jer released from EDG Jail looking to make himself a name on this IG roster 11k on the Elder TP is going to be up for rookie and the shy in 20 seconds but that's not enough time and well Jed trying to put on the game of his life kavi has other things to say deathless on his signat has one chance the blast count he goes in no way J steals it and saves time for IG and the only passive will burn down k na'vi at 369 are you kidding me and now they get the baron as well offer the steel into taking down the jungle into taking down the top laner into taking the baron and this game is right back in their hands I'm at a loss for words they they top Esports knew that there was a control ward in the dragon pit but they feel confident that kabi would get the Smite secure but jedet proves him wrong and suddenly rude for all the disadvantages that IG had throughout the entire game there suddenly for the first time up as now going to Chris solar flare tries to lock down rookie cream sinks it up with the curtain call in the spiraling despair but it's still not enough damage to threaten rookie quite yet Jed's in looks for it goes a little crazy trying maybe he goes a little too far and IG have bit off more than they could chew maybe they got a little too crazy in their heads thinking that they had the world at their fingertips but now it's slipping through top Esports they don't have to worry about a baron expiring anytime soon since it's already been taken away and 2 and A2 minutes on this buff but man oh man this is awesome I love this rude okay I don't want to tell people to Cal down because this is crazy and it deserves the hype that it's getting but the death onto JJ there costs IG big they had an opportunity with Baron with elder to end this game but with that death it stalls them for a minute that means that the Elder probably not going to get any effect at all off the back of this and it relies now on what IG can do with just this Baron the shy spotting out canavi but in a massive sequence of plays after all of it we're fighting again they still are looking to Skirmish are they willing to throw the game all on the line for a red buff no not quite yet iig it looked a little dicey as top eorts were ready to throw down the gauntlet once again with the solar flare but it did not hit anyone we have to we have to look at this again let's go all the way back to when just sthers his way in Q Plus Smite secures it perfect timing perfect damage and the stasis as well canavi can do nothing is he just watch es himself bleeded out tick down to the Elder and again we return now to a game state where IG begin to be favored now where they are that little bit further ahead where JJ finds himself now 3,000 gold over his counterpart but other than that we're largely even across the board Jacky love with a small Advantage he's almost six items cream as well nearly there if a couple of kills had gone his way and he didn't have 4 assists maybe he they've been in a pretty good spot but IG with this bar they've only got 45 seconds left their objective should be to break open the base but I'm looking at it rough and it doesn't look too likely we're 43 minutes in we've already had an elder and a baron I think we're du for another one of each oh man don't tell me that rude it just means that both of these teams are going to go for another round oh hang on the Shy might be the target here a lot of CC and he's still very tanky to be able to live through it all but the bleed of the death stands almost taking him down but not quite enough as he's able to survive and sustain through the use of those Shields STK Gage also providing him with enough durability to survive what could have been a big pick for topy sports and again it's a now neutral game all of those advantages that IG found and all of those situations that top had put themselves in not really important anymore we we return to who can get prior over mid lane who can set up for these objectives in an appropriate fashion Jackie love hitting that full build we look to Summoner spells everybody on top orts pretty much ready to go with those just missing crisp flash is another means of engage J looking to get his flash back up the Shai won't have that ambessa flash for any fights that happen around those objectives unless we're able to stall for four or five minutes even when they are live mid lane prior goes the way of Taren in a series uh of two teams that are looking to not get knocked out of the LPL this is exactly the type of fight I'm looking to see them put up yes everyone on both teams giving all they got because they know what the stakes and the repercussions could be to drop a game at this point for IG dropping a game means that they are putting their backs against the wall Match Point tournament point on the line going forward top Esports they dropped this game and suddenly the morale the momentum shift that they could have had is now lost and it's back to even State and it would be a mountain for topy sports to climb especially having such a advantageous and strong early game that they slowly built up it would be so crushing just to lose it now and I love the little toggle there from The Observers what runes does Jackie love running is he running Gathering storm quick little hit marker oh yes he is 791 ad on this genin at the minute that is a abnormal amount of AD to be able to find in a game and if we take over to 50 minutes Mark which I I don't know that we'll get there but that's going to go up once again block on the four one of the shots there with the unbreakable you can see Guardian getting some decent value but Quay is just going to give you pryo in this fight in this Lane as well sets up the Wave Control so much earlier than any the champion can Bon rookie fighting for posture on this top River brush top Esports still maintaining control and first entrance into the Elder Dragon good shielding from cream to keep Jacky love safe as he is remembering as well when canavi shields or heals Jacko he gets more ad from the attack speed that it gives him mm not typically the combo that you yeah not the combo you normally think of when you think of n attack speed buff over to an 0 carry but it works for Jin as Now topy Sports ending their formation towards the bottom River oh K kavi might be caught here forced to flash away the lilting Low by Rus crisp is in the middle of all of them spirling despair on the shy as he blinks over with the public execution is taken out by Jackie love that's the damage that's the Gathering store but J has other on his mind as he's able to carry it through Q flash into multiple members but is it going to be enough it's all on the shy he has to car can he do the damage Jackie is pump it the shy still has to deal with the G the spawn kavi can he keep his ad carry alive Jackie loves got so much HP good flash by the in of top e Sports and that's it top e Sports Prevail through the most gruesome fight we have seen in the LPL yet of the first split of the season but damn B Jackie loves Jen cuz no one doesn't like him he won them game two in their best of three in the Deasia and he wins them game two in the best of five that could very well knock out IG from the LPL Jackie love and Jin are pairing a mat made in heaven The Observers are noting that the minion wave is coming in but death timers are not short enough that I think it's going to matter top Esports will bring this series to match point two Z against IG and Jackie love again with a standout performance this time he solo rookie in the back half of that fight rapid fire cannon into rapid fire cannon into calling the curtain on rookie and sending him back to the gray screen several massive bullets that just destroyed top destroyed IG and top Esports coming up in the clutch they put themselves to 2 and it's another game where IG fought and they battled and they did everything that they could and and J in particular I think this time round you know game number one we were highlighting Gala for his Miracle performance game two jit still deserves MVP even though they lost I mean game one he stole a Baron game two he steals an elder dragon and it's just so heartbreaking that it's still not enough to bring IG back from the brink I mean jeda is literally doing his damnest now it doesn't necessarily excuse a couple moments where he got a little little too overextended but man rude when I when I look back at that game overall that was the closest and the definitely the best fighting that IG have put up yet against top orts not just in this series but overall over in the Deasia cup when they first faced off against each other and I have to say rude there's two words and I want you to get your hands together put them up like this absolute Cinema absolute Cinema I mean JJ's JJ's play around the Elder Drake it deserves it right it was such a clutch play um but the again Talent of top Esports ends up ringing true um and we were questioning okay what's crisp going to look like on these leoner engages this was a composition that was built around crisp being the engage our criticisms of crisp and of top orts had been around when crisp was looking for those engages and Bayern La dra I think an marked improvement on crisp's work uh in this series and in that game in particular right that was a lot of Leon orties yeah maybe sometimes you're fishing and you're not quite Landing but occasionally he was burning cleanse burning stasis burning just enough of a tool to give top that fight and there was that one shaky engage right second set of grubs IG come out on top Cris throws his life away by Zenith blading forward then on in he learned his lesson there was some very adaptive practice there where he was like ah I will stop and I will no longer throw my life away if my team can't follow and that instant recognition is ultimately a tool that led them to take this game yeah and I just have to give massive props and not just Chris but also kavi being able to be in such greater sync this game alone than you know compared to a lot of the games that we saw over the course of the group stage and even Deasia cup as well I mean this is a roster we talked about before that they are coming together for the first time not having played together previously in other teams since kavi was a franchise jdg player for so long over 5 years this is his first time that he's not played for jdg I mean there's going to be growing pains whenever you come to a new roster like that and obviously a lot of those growing pain showed quite disturbingly in in the group stage I mean the Olaf game in particular was one that frankly hopefully gets erased from history's existence for kavi sake but he showed up big time on this n man I for me there's there's three nit players in the entire world that I've always am Overjoyed to see being pulled out and it's Canyon shun and kavi and when any of those three pull out an Italy I'm expecting big plays I'm expecting the absolute world master class of this cougar and I mean boy oh boy did he deliver I mean the the the One Elder steel I'm going to take a point away but other than that kavi pretty much had a Flawless game on the kavi you can see does the most damage in this game like and by far as well it's worth mentioning right like he is you know playing a poke champion and the expectation is that poke Champs deal the most damage in a game but so infrequently does that actually happen and so infrequently is it nides as well that actually get to do that most damage uh kavi I I'm right there with you pulled out a very very solid nly performance and you know flashing onto Gala right taking him out of the game I think that the we're going to struggle to try and find who they want as the MVP for me it is Jackie love that just performed in the clutch when he needed to but like there are so many arguments for so many different people and in a 50 odd minute game you know you can find so many different times and so many different ways in which uh somebody performed well I think cream whilst he didn't get any highlight moments was consistent and very consistent in this game for top Esports so you know there's there's so many different ways to look at this as to who was the reason that top came out on top and ultimately it comes down to an understanding that actually everybody did their job and did it really well yeah the thing that makes me happy the most for uh a top Esports perspective is that this is a very similar composition that they ran against lgd in their group stage where kavi was on the n k was on The Quay I don't remember exactly what the other pieces were for top eorts off the top of my head but I know that in a similar manner cream was even though not high on the kills he was creating so much space and making it so difficult for the opposition to get in because q's and uh qws being able to snipe people away or just create these terrains of Battlefield where it's just really hard to cross over and the spiling despairs and the fears that he's throwing out it opens up so many windows but frankly in the lgd series kavi looked nowhere near as good on the n as he did here and this was kind of the the resurrection of the N performance the kavi carry that we've come to know over his career with jdg and really the expectations we wanted to see from this guy this is a good sign for top Esports fans in in particular because now you can say hey they struggled against lgd which was a team that should be fairly lower in the terms of Power Rankings and they are performing against IG who even though they're struggling as well this game was probably the best that they've played so far this split and it was no pushover performance and still top eorts triumphed yeah this was this was both teams I think performing largely at capacity I think rookie unfortunately had a really shaky game and like really got exposed in this back half as one of the weaker parts of this IG roster this game round um and for the most part I would argue that probably all nine other players were doing their job for the most part and getting as much out of their Champion as much out of their kit as they could do um and you know if that's what it ends up falling down to just one of the players not quite having that same stand out as as we were maybe hoping for then that's how it ends up falling but again to to look at creem and to say this is a player that is now surrounded by literally nine other players that have all got International success and domestic success as well cre yes he's been to an international but he's not won one yet this is a player who definitely doesn't match that pedigree but is putting up better numbers than rookie doing more in these games yeah this is these are the confidence games that you want in your opening split with a new you know kind of a new assemble of the team second year with the organization of top Esports Kem just wants to continue racking up these big games as much as possible even if he's not the star because in this game it was kavi NY yeah gets player of the game again I think there's there's an argument for Jackie love Taking It In fairness uh and obviously canavi losing out on that Elder was a pretty big dis Turning Point almost in this game but that doesn't take away from and I don't think has you know by given the way he gets the player of the game from what was otherwise a incredible performance for 47 of the 48 minutes it played I mean pretty much that is the kind of nit gameplay all nit solo Q Mains aspire to have on a consistent basis so that they can just hard Smurf through the ladder but for us that's going to do it at least for game numeral do game three will be coming up soon after this break and it is match point for top Esports win this game they send IG home and they continue through the lower bracket let's find out

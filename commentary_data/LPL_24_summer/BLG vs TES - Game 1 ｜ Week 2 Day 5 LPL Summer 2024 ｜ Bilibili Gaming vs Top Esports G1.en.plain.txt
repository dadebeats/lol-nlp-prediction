have been really really good at having Tien calling the shots they're hovering over that sedani and while the LPL has largely been an AP farming matter this Sani has been an absolute wrecking ball for TI in the one game that we've seen from him so far it's first pick locked in we've seen this about the place who've seen it in bits and pieces from so a on nip likes this this pick the Renekton I'm surprised it got through the bands I think Top Lane match up could be so so important and the renon because it is such a lane dominant pick for two magnificent players of the champion it's going to be very valuable throughout this series wouldn't surpris me to see that lock it I hope you're ready for the gang Renekton answer Quinn up there in the top Lan BR Zoom yeah I mean 369 him and zoom they were they were the ones trading it you know back in the day that's a little while ago now has Ash also been left open and available so often banned here in the LPL but elk can grab that possibly goes to on but I would anticipate think it's going to go to Elk and I think now top might even need to have to consider taking away uh brao cuz I think Ash Brom is in disgusting combo it's also very very good with the Sani I don't think you can allow that to go over to on on that side of course it could be towards that support but I feel like that's been the best that we've seen uh that Euro come through top was hovering over a whole bunch of stuff they lock in the Jace and the assist so this is likely both soloers locks in 369 saying all right it is carry time Jace versus the re and top side spicy Top Lane match up certainly is just saying a zop has been played within the last couple of years it's not totally out of the question a range top laner I don't think 369 is the guy though to be honest I do expect that as it to go to mid lane for creen and over to the side of blg we've already seen it a couple of times today nly a powerful pick and shuns hands some of the best in the world at it it will be the rata in the end alongside elk Ash so it's not going to be the the combat that we've typically seen from the LPL which is the Ash braw Ash rard is disgustingly Lane dominant though the level one is very powerful with the Loyalty protocol and then also the Vol as well from the ash so top East who haven't locked their bot Lane yet might lose themselves stuff like the Leona of course that's one of the most powerful picks wouldn't surprise me to see them lose something um like the varis or something more Lane dominant too and they might find themselves in a difficult position ezal also a worthwhile ban here something that puts top be for into a position where they can't just safely Farm out or combat the spot Lan there's a lot of picks that when you play against Ash you get hit by that b for just a second she will chase you down the lane it's really difficult to escape that fin the attack speed or Gibs the ash as well makes it really really difficult to be able to contest or to be able to escape kind of rocking a hard place sort of situation the fight taken away from shundo like we really are seeing a big meta shift here in the LPL with the fight taken off the sitani first picked then it is going to be that Kindred has and this is why it is so great to see our top teams playing together here uh one big thing which is obviously missing from BL is Magic damage right now so we have to see whether Knight or shun is going to pick up something along those lines I haven't particularly loved Knight on a lot of the ad mid laners I think that's been one of the reasons his form has wavered recently but it does mean uh that it would just stop Shan from going towards AP junglas he goes towards that nly you have nly Renekton you have the ash AR as well for setup it's a champ which he's played an awful lot but it is pretty difficult to play especially against the team as organizes top orts top orts have just looked absolutely absurd in their form we already saw an or hovered earlier on make I think one of the best ORS in the league weirdly enough as a support you wouldn't expect that to be the case but he just doesn't seem to miss CS Jack you love we all know how terrifying this Senate can be it's 100% win rate he's got 11 KDA across four games this split and mo I mean the nless would be available too but I feel like has been so comfortable on this on again also 100% win rate because this is the combo they keep playing also you're into an ash you're into a rata they can't escape that on Ultimate they haven't locked in something like a brao which could lock out that on Ultimate as well so top e was fantastic late game or mid game team fighting last pick tonight it looks like it's an early game composition from blg does Knight want to go towards something that can snowball a bit in that mid lane he hasn't played this for a little while in summer but he might just be the very best player in the world at that AR the LeBlanc also being hovered I think they need something early game to snowball with all of these hovers different flavors of it sadly not going to see one of those AR blancs going to see that yon instead which is probably his best of the ad mid laners that he's shown it's still not necessarily been his comfort certainly has uh found games against the azir over the years though we've seen times where these melee assassins things like the Yoni the aali the silus can find their angles and punish air in the mid lane but is here cream's first like control Mage that he was able to pick up and start to become proficient on in that mid lane when he first transitioned away from just assassins now we'll be tested against n but I'm looking at the Top Lane man Jace versus Renekton 369 versus bin there's just no way that's not entertaining and the fact that Top Lane has been a determining factor for so many LPL series recently and we have the two two of our very best top lers going at it this should be an absolute treat so often you sleep on Top Lane we have the Cante versus the scar n re and Jace these will snowball very very hard I think what that means is that because it is such an intricate 1 V one match up the second a jungler gets a good angle up there it could determine so much of the game Tien shun early pathing also on the menu right now because if they manage to influence one of these lanes and TI has done that very very well recently it could flip such a snowb lane into their advantage well it's time to get into game number one isn't it blg versus top Esports here their first series each of this Ascend group both of them dominating within their groups top eorts Flawless blg losing that one fiful game against lgd but now the real games are a f now we're into the main group stage of the LPL and top e Sports and VG play time is over it is time for a serious match up this is a matchup that could change everything for playoffs when it comes to head to head top eorts blg it's time for game [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] one all right off the bat we're in trouble here 369 slowed by the ash the center slow to respond but 369 hold in after the Flash and first blood for night you couldn't ask for more for blg Jace goes down Chase loses Flash and in the snowballing match up the top play be take less than a minute to make their mark on this series this is the this is the match up we were saying that top e should maybe get the upper hand in now top e have looked better than blg but we've been asking okay we're in the rumble stage now we have to turn on the heat are you ready for it the fact that they get that kill that very very important playing without a flash into uh the renon nidle is a bit of a death sentence if Shin can get up there in time for B to get himself another stun that can be so so huge they started as a fiveman level one stack you often do that versus Range Top Lane is to get brush control stop that J kind of dipping in and out to drop minion aggro they do that and 369 he just doesn't respect this enough gets the move speed change from the from going in towards that hammer but as you said in Champion sled one slow from Ash is all it takes at that level one runs him down with or without that flash great punish from blg starting strong really nice Flash from on as well like understanding that 369 is going to flash away flash is almost exactly the same time and finds that handshake to start the game strong elen on now forcing pry down in the bottom side against the center and or nothing you can do against double ranged here for Center on and it will be a slow win in the bottom side for blg to start us off here jaula already chumped to half as well fantastic little start for blg obviously Knight will be pushed in in the mid lane and up top 369 will be able to get an early Advantage as J against Ren yeah that's the Advantage the thing is with this kind of composition with the Hawk Shot you can spot out the the uh sujani and by knowing where the sujani is he gives shun some extra options blg some extra options believe that's the fan but screen who they think is going to come through but already jackula is getting absolutely monstered out of this Lane blg do need to win early game with this compostition they have dominant early Lanes potentially that can snowball but they have to make that happen if topies will reach one two items I think the team fights going to be very hard for blg to play so they need to keep on this kind of tempo feel like on has been one of the players on blg who's not necessarily been on his greatest form so far this splits uh turns out this game he's on a really good form so far so good on the rata and you know rata a pick that I think on really changed people's perspectives of him on you know when he first came into the league he was the raan guy he was the alist guy he was the da sky and I feel like rata was the first enchanter where he really started to separate himself from the pack and show everyone that he wasn't just an Engaged support you know this is a guy with serious potential and you know couple of years on now it's one of the very best in the world absolutely you know back when he was on WBO he had a couple of real stinkers back there to the point where the community SE oh no not this guy losing his games this guy single-handedly won blg so many games and now blg they have grown into a team which can absolutely snowball around that b side the fact that they have this early Lane dominance definitely helps them they need to keep this up because we know exactly how Well Jack 11 Mo can play when they're ahead of the game as well so blg yet to make a big power play outside of that level one it's just been kind of ping ponging some waves back and forth we haven't seen shun get a farm advantage over ten sometimes the nle can absolutely blow a Sani out of the water even on the first clear shun is well they nearly very very good against those tank matchups trying to make a work play happen now though with that jungle support rotation and the Hawk Shot giving in the map hacks ten spotted shun at that point decides it's time to move into River rather than trying to get into that lane on has moved up to the top side of the map Grub's not up for another 90 seconds but tenen manages to side step from the spear but a Smite from shun will take the grumper now threatening a potential dive onto 369 he still doesn't have flash available there only three Caster minions and TN in the area and will be called off by blg think it's pretty hard to make a dive like that because topies are packing at the extra teleport they have that on moo yes was sat down there on the bot side but because TM seen on top side hadn't taken a chunk and you have that teleport it's quite hard for blg to make that play much better to just kind of walk away with the Grump steel and call it a bit of a smaller win rather than the bigger one instead of falling prey to what top was could do in regards to those globals jaul love now out on the map as well so he's trying to make sure he present he can want to blg's Lane push quite an important uh recall denial there as well as Knight has that TP available cre has already reset and come back to Lane so Knight sticks around for another wave now we'll go for that recall but importantly grubs are up in 30 seconds Drake already onto the map so the mid laner from blg heading back to base right now isn't ideal for the squad he does have the teleport of course p is just used KN needs another need to wait for uh another break in the waves it's like um if you ever been surfing you get like that little break in the set of waves you kind of do that that's your Cannon wave right you push that in it makes it easy if you get that recall and teleport back in he's doing so again now another Fork shot coming through from Elk keeping that information on updated blg really need to keep using that CU that's what's really going to give them that extra drop on the first play on the map Elon continue to push in shun now revisiting this bottom Lane they know Tien just recall and the spear hits onto make the dive is underway maker with a double knock but the r comes through as well top be SP out play on goes down one for one Jula flashes to safety but it's answered by shun who grabs a double on the cougar oh blg they are do a bit of betting on the stock market they get bailed out by on on the rata dies under the turret but that's only cost that comes through luckily Moo can teleport back into that lane but what did we say about blg they need to get that early dominance and need to keep playing through that bot side if at all possible it's what their players want it's what their Champions want blg get some kills they're going to trade the objectives afterwards yes the grubs going over to top eorts are quite nice for them but given that blg are kind of playing towards the early Lane I think they're pretty happy to use that to leverage into a soul condition as well if they can stack up multiple early dragons feels like a fantastic start for blg thousand gold lead they got that first Dr oh spear from across the map and arrow from Elk Into the Heart of 369 bin he has his One V one it's not really a One V one is actually knocked away from tn's Ultimate and PES for an easy kill B making him look DED in the top side Dash just under power elk with the layup and B with a home run Tak it out the trash Reon gets so many empowered abilities onto the Jace and sadly for 369 it hasn't really felt like his own fault but blg have just managed to slam dunk onto his Lane said that the Renekton needs to get ahead of the chce if it's all possible an arrow like that is an absolute top draw way to do it it is absolutely across the map Robin Hood elk Nails Jason you can see that b hereit manages to m manage his rage really really well pops his Dominus gets the armor shred for the empowered e Waits until the rage Stacks up the stun is ended gets an empowered W after that point and after this uses the last tick of his rage again get himself that last empowered ability using every single one of his abilities in their empowered version to get that kill incredible stuff what an arrow from Elk what a followup from B in the 2v one no less I will say 369 hammering him away just just as the Sani flies in really unfortunate for top orts looking a little off kiled today it looks like blg have thrown this first punch and it has sent top Esports spinning for the time being I think so much of that has come from this ash the level one the Haw shots the arrows the ability to push the lane Mo has the call of the forge on will be that tget look at the CC moo and Jackie love make a mockery of blg just talking about oh this ash causing so many problems for top Esports gets absolutely dunked or at least the lane partner does in that bot Lane you cannot rule out top esorts and the power of their individual players at the same time jackalo now at two and one got that first kill um against the rard of course it is going to be the fasting Center not going to be getting too much of that up another one one in top side oh so much for a counter pick 369 is in big trouble the crop stacking up in the top side Dominus not going to be enough to get a kill here TP available for three 69 he is going to head back to base though as B won't quite be able to finish that kill let's take another look at Lane ah spear misses spear misses sh if you hit that one maybe you just one shot the center that could be a skill shot which uh gives top Esports just a glimmer of hope in this early game they've been blown out of the water in the early game which is typically where they have succeeded so much blg have picks for early game this is another Spar on the Scuttle crab what a good look buddy try to hit the next one but top Esports getting themselves on the page in this early game so so important for them if they survive through to two items or so I think they can really smash through these team fights getting gold like that very much helps flash burn by 369 there the Renekton n it's a classic up in the top side 369 knows it if the Renekton stun hits the spear is guaranteed even shun can't miss that one uh that's a bit unfair I think shun one of the best got in the league but just an unfortunate couple of minutes jackula has actually moved up to the top side he's pretending not to be here for now but the soul popping out of the minion will give the game away yeah they should know at this point the grubs are spawning in under a minute so you typically do move your Bot Lane up there you can see that on is also moving to that side of the map elk and moo staying towards the bot side so there won't be a full 5v5 and top side should those grubs spawn BG don't really wants to give the six grubs over that would be a bit powerful of an objective lead to get through that point Jackal 369 now playing double ranged against the renant he'll be able to wave clear a little bit then probably going to have to head back up to this point top might be gifted those cuz I'm not sure B can really stick around and contest for that kills tough for B up in that top side as the COC in a 2V1 and like you say TI there alongside jaul I was going to say should set up for gross but instead they're setting up for a dive in his top to tank this one dashes back under bit of sustain there but the damage is too much and it's 369 to grab kill the shun arrives to get the wave wasn't sure if he' gone too far there does hit a spear on to 369 on is in the air if they want to keep pushing I don't think they will sh just going to try and clear this wave and then should be able to back over towards moves in they are going to go for this one of course they're going to go for this one looking for the handshake 369 side steps it the spear goes wide as well and now it's jula's turn to have a little go yeah jaula really really helping by roaming up early using that Center even when Center has zero items you're still a range Shady carry with a decent amount of burst early you can really startop threaten oh the horn combo comes through from moo doesn't find the W in the midst and suddenly El walk it away but the flash to finish the job moo is One auto from a solo kill onto the enemy ad carry Mo gives himself a celebratory barrier Ben trying to even the score 369 in trouble on and Sh moving in nowhere to go on this one the ignite comes in and Sh will finish the job as on tanks the tower nearly steep back under the tower there but they're okay 3694 green TPS up no sorry make TPS up to the top side to catch this he does it all he uses the barrier gets the teleport after goes back towards that top side and this is now a big issue for blg they were really dominating the early Lanes they were getting some good combos hereabouts but giving so much gold over the top easts on a composition which will transition into team fights very very well is starting to worry me you can see that you know the fact that jackula has gone up into Bin's Lane means that bin doesn't have an isolated 1 V one and because Mak is just the best or in the world is just solo killing everyone he's got like a solo killer game on this pick at this point the centeral doesn't land for the damage but does land for the shield gets himself a huge kill here and even elk is not immune to mako's on and I think moo actually kind of baited elk in there by using the W on the wave he's like oh my or combo isn't available but he can still just do kind of a delayed finish to the combo instead of using the W for the Triple knockup and it sets up for a solar kill Mo phenomenal stuff so far is Knight now wants a chance to get in the game himself little tag on to 369 but with TN there as well has to back away we have barely talked about mid lane it's all a bit about s Side Lane so far we will wait and see whether cre and Knight can get themselves any big impact in this game we're getting towards the point where you can put your mid laners into s side Lanes try and get them some s Side Lane gold at this point has a load of gold he not been able to leverage it just yet sh on the two Z and two one stack on the dark seal most gold in the game it's very very powerful but blg again it comes back to this question saying okay all right the early game's been good what do you do when you get to 55s against the Sani in the OR of that front line you're playing with the nle you're playing with a reaon they do get increasingly harder to play as the game goes on FG have put themselves on hard mode if they don't get themselves much more of an advantage if they use this heral to break open a big turret that might be it but they might have to fight for it 7K on that Herald and the arrow goes in on creep The Flash for the handshake but the wall of soldiers blocks it and then a ran charges through the blg knocked to Su by Mo as El will fall as well it's beautiful answer from Top eorts now night in trouble 369 the old solo Lane is up against each other once Brothers but no longer says Knight as he finds the kill onto his old teammate bin now trying to escape from Jackie love and Mak who look for more it's an absolute scrap on the rift Knight showing that he can't just only move in L's like a chest piece he hands one to 369 with love from jdg to blg tien's going to stop and take this Top Lane cup but he might have just overstayed B can absolutely lock him in place for sh ten has stayed far too long for this one this St come through but he doesn't have any real damage to speak of with three players tenen will fall that will finally be the herald for blg three grubs a piece one Drake a piece 27k gold a piece we are practically even I don't really know how to pass this last fight as well the he is going to go to blg but as we were saying even though it kind of comes out slimly in blg's favor there is so much gold going up to people on top eSource with a team which will be very happy in mid game then I'm not willing to call this like a big victory for blg I think cream managing to get the shuffle out here delays the pick for so long that BG can't get a clean pick they end up using multiple Mobility tools to go forward and they don't have that to go out at that point they funnel up for this huge Wombo coming in from moo oh my word mak's on it just keeps delivering luckily the solar laners from blg managed to pull some back Ben gets one kill and Knight gets himself now suddenly two kills out of the middle of nowhere he's got two and two and0 on the O8 369 maybe just miscalculating that one yeah KN obviously having one kill from the level one that helped him get to a first so damn quickly now with the second kill on top of it Drake coming up not for another minute and a half here but that will be the next objective looking towards where shun ends up throwing that Herald as well whether it will be towards that mid lane or perhaps looking for a chance onto cream here Knight moves over shun here to but spotted on a ward shouldn't lead to anything I'm trying to think really where you want to put that Herald and more importantly who do you want to put that gold into I'm trying to think of this composition from Top you have a very strong front line in that Sani and the or it can be really hard for the Rea Act without gold but is he really the most efficient person to put that gold into if the Y gets ahead I think that's probably more valuable in regards to making a way through the front line to the back line if your ultimate tags people in the back line you catch everyone in it that front line cut body block that fate sealed so maybe KN he should be gifted that maybe a heral can go towards that of course though haral always very valuable on that mid lane out of if you can get that kill as well so blg important decision is coming up for them and they need to make it effectively because if they don't get a big Power Play out of this heral I really do again keep Haring on about this sack you're probably getting bored at this point if they don't get big advantages teams get really really nasty later we just saw the WBO looked like that was like a one item what happens at three yeah it becomes terrifying it really really does especially playing the way that he is that is a scary Prospect for blg like I say they've got that minor lead they need to turn into a major lead Drake spawning onto the map top eorts will not give them a single inch without a fight as the changeing the key from minor to Major trying to make it a happier sounding song for blg they leaving B in this top side he doesn't run that demolish right now on this uh on this matchup so he's going to be just taking some damage without that was choing to give up the dragon spawn but maybe looking to shut down bin instead Mega can cast the alts no flash up for bin either he's just used his slice won't get a dice out of this one call of the forge God finds the knock up that's the brittle Pro into the W into 369 grabbing himself a kill Knight will answer with a tier one the Drake will go down for blg as well the top e spots happy to trade elsewhere yeah so I think blg they get themselves an important Dragon it's a mountain Rift as well if they can get themselves a mountain so later they are very very happy with this KN getting gold is also valuable but now you start to worry about what happens with the Renekton only 100 gold ahead of 369 who even though he was kind of dunked on in the early game is almost even in gold with that champion B is a good Renekton player he has a good history on this Champion but 369 if he's even with him after all of the resources put into the Reon blg will probably be looking at that as a bit of a failed investment as they move forward into the mid game where suddenly we are getting closer towards that to I it's kind of crazy that 369 has four deaths this game but he's even like that is not something you see too often there's been so much time get you a team that can bail you out like to seriously ironic really because rata is over on the side of blg you'd think the would be in their favor but top eorts still managing to make it work somehow jackula being a huge influence in this game as well the way he's been moving around the map the way he's been pairing up with Mo like that combo we saw towards heral from make a lot of that set up by Jackie's route as well to make sure that the followup knockup can hit multiple players heral comes down into the mid lane won't end up in a tower but we set that up for later it's a bit of a pain that they don't get to kill that tower on that wave it's going to be quite hard to move back there's a lot of wave there on top Esports big hle take over and jaul cleanses everything including the arrow there I think if TM gets hit by that arrow that might just be a kill but jaulo tanks it for his teammate uses that cleans doubles it up double value on the Summoner spell 80 Stacks by the way on Jacko getting close to that 100 Mark as now sh moves up to this top side cre the one that has to try and escape the play this time but a TP comes through from 369 Knight just shy on his ultimate ah Knight I think he might have made a mistake there by Leading with that Soul Unbound if he just gone for the Q forwards maybe he would have been able to stick around longer while threatening his Al there but he has just going towards the end of that timer on that Soul return does get a Teleport out of moo it's only for the ultimate of Knight it's not the biggest cool down to use at that point that blg shame they couldn't take that to the last time look at the CC chain on to El but he flashes away from the call of the forge God that's a 5minute cool down for a what 9 second cool down I think you'll take that for the side of top Esports and also threatening on the bot side 369 wants to finish this Tower might just be able to bin can threaten him but 369 knows how confident he is knows he can challenge the 1 V one with TM on that side of the map he was happy to step up one for one on the sidelane towers and a lot of gold being given over to the Y Knight has not necessarily looked his most comfortable on the Y he's had a couple of those Ms he's kind of had a swing in a Miss with his ultimate but he is getting to the point where he's going to go back for you know another big item coming off of this he has been given so much gold between the kills and the sidelane turrets Knight has to do the carrying I have to say blg have not really had to rely on the Knight to do the carrying it's not necessarily been the first Port of Call he needs to do it in this game has a shield bow now it'll help him get past that front line and survive a bit longer into those team fights if he doesn't get team fight value I find it really hard to believe that blg can win that fight bin is not going to be that much of a factor now he's gone for the St on the reaon he'll be a delaying Factor but he won't be a carry he has now been put behind that Jace so much of this is on night top eorts need to make sure that yonel doesn't hit their key carries trying to get this crab here theg look to contest with Shun in the area oh tn's in the area too it's a Smite off and tenen wins it that's a lot of vision control but T might have put his life on the line for it no full commitment from blg just uh toying with the idea of a scrap over that crab there two items now picked up by elk as well so this ash starting to get to that stage in the game Call of the forge got flashed by on but it hits on to sh and the rest of the CC chain lands on to on regardless another kill for cre wonderful patience from TI showing what the Sani can do now you're at that kind of two item spot blg they might look for a bit bit of a flank here there's no would be looking for a 4v5 and here's the arrow Arrow from Al as they dive onto the back side you said you wanted something from Knight there it is another kill on to 369 Jack caught by The Croc and blg now King backwards has been tanks for the team cream doesn't have to damage to finish anymore well there you go Knight gets the AL onto the back line and blg managed to walk away with something cream manages to just about save the rest of his teene with a shuffle and a tower that was well needed at that point but blg showing something and it's 20 minutes they are going for a baron Rush they're going for the double TP blg turning on the afterburners in Thea in the no call the forge got available though for top e sports that's their big engage to TN just has to pray for a miracle could be a 50/50 as gets a double knock up but KN goes in just starts to threaten as the rest of the team goes on to the baron hostile take over is massive and it's a kill onto make TP comes through from 369 to join the action but the baron goes down blg in the pit is 51 Falls over the wall 369 trying to find Revenge but he finds pulled back in gets one gets two and here comes Jackie to finish the job the snip for the slow as CR looks for a third but out takes him down and suddenly one for one on the back side of the fight Knight now trying to escape will do so it's AB chaos catch it breath show it is a certified B top East Wass blg it had to deliver it is delivering blg try and take a mile when they're shown an inch they do get away with the baron but only on one person one big fight in the mid lane off of Knight's big ultimate leads to that Baron start but the respawn's coming just in time for this is actually quite a long way into that play see that blg they're trying to get a compromise between staying on the bar and getting kills at the other side they get a kill onto make but because they aren't killing the baron very quickly they're taking so much damage from it they take so much damage from it and it means that 369 and cream can end up getting some clean up damage Beyond this point it is so close and because BG they do get a lot of kills alongside the one bar they do technically still come out ahead from this despite the fact they would like to have a couple more Baron Buffs to their name cream absolutely smurfing in this fight but so is El gets an arrow off at the last second and turns it around with a kraken Auto I love watching these two teams play they know each other so well you know that they were scrimming leading up to Internationals 7,000 damage from in the last fight that is absurd a third Drake though for BG that's sole point for them but in trade for one because top eorts have pushed down the mid lane and nearly taken an inhib Tower uh they don't take it fully though so blg they'll be able to Rally behind uh their mid lane and get themselves there blg do have that bar buff on cream who sat their wave cling which means that they couldn't push any harder top they are getting to the point where they can start the death ball now and they G to to night night this is not the time to be caught out this is not the series to be caught out a huge pick for top orts I don't think there's much they can find off the back of it luckily for blg uh the thing with that is though that's the last Baron buff blg they just lost the last Baron buff there Knight ends up dying uh just in his own jungle not really sure what he was looking for they top e they have reached the point in the game where they can death Pall this was the danger point for blg do they have the lead to last out it's only 1,000 gold lead they are however on Soul point they are going to be hanging on to that lead by their absolute fingertips digging in the fingers to see if they can hold on to this just long enough for that Dragon to come up the top Esports Squad fin night alone in the jungle and jackula Whispers after all this time as always oh dear bit of a miss that BR like what a banger this has been we're only in game one and it's already lived up to all of the expectations I could HED for 27 kills on the board 26 minutes on the clock and this is with an AZ cop on one side of the scoreboard it's still an absolute bloodbath on the rift no neutrals up for a couple of minutes I'm not sure that necessarily stop these two teams fighting no and particularly blg from fighting because they're getting to a point where the reekon in the nly are getting increasingly less value we talked about it earlier let's check on it now you're not that far ahead on the Italy you're not ahead at all the Arrow's missing that's going to be a pain blg they want to get these split picks they want to find someone with an ash Arrow before the death wall gets split um set up get a spear On Target as well and see if they can get themselves a big kill before top e start to team fight them in Earnest they've done a fairly good job of finding some of those picks but it is going to get that much harder you're getting towards three items now onto big Caris and because also Jackie look has so many kills even though he's the first Exel he has 100 Souls he's at a very high range at this point he's got a lot of gold too he's almost on his way to his third item too even if they are cheaper than Elks on the other side we're getting to the point where both sides are hitting there with conditions right You've Got Cream close to three items on the azir as well you know 369 very much online as that chase has the upgraded version of sheras as well so the Poke is very real from the side of top Esports but elk on three items Jack show now finished for Knight as well these carries are no slouches shun on his signature nly pick 41 and seven this game close to three items five stacks on a dark seal later on in the game is where nidle gets hard and that is where players like shun have often separated themselves from all the other nid plays yeah it is um one of those Champions like your Le sins that scale the difficulty with skill they don't necessarily do less damage but it's harder to get there big damage from 369 we were talking about how strong he is has flash will have to use it call of the forge got used now and B gets onto the flank hostile take over to try and set up but the damage isn't there b the one sent packing instead as scam looks for a little bit more and finds it onto shun no casualties but top orts gain control yeah and Al loses flash it's really really bad that's combo coming on in cre found and will be taken down but it's in trade for night no dash is last second still taken down somehow the auto followed him and onf fell with him suddenly bar spawning in 20 seconds top eorts with control and even an arrow onto the carry can't save blg they just can't find the damage at the right moment before the turn around comes back and it's so dangerous to approach this shun he's got to try you got to walk up and see what you can do the baron spawning but he might just die for the attack they're just waiting for him he had to make something happen he had to try and find an angle but top eorts have all of that information too they know he's going to be cheeky and they punish it immediately that will be for top orts pings on towards the Drake from the side of blg but he's not on for another 40 seconds yeah so what blg will want to do is get some control over bot side They Know The Baron's going over it's going over a little slower than I thought it might do and maybe that'll open up assault for that so elk he gets caught out losing flash on ash is pretty horrid against this kind on the comp it's very hard to play against that later there is a lot of Wombo available from blg but it doesn't hit the backl doesn't hit cream doesn't hit Jack love so they have to back off from that you cannot go into the soldiers and Senna who stood behind the front line like that the arrow is fantastic from Elk who catches cream Midway through an auto attack animation he tries to flash but the the fat flat Shing CES him luckily for the side of top East Knight also can't get back to his safety it does mean that both of him and on go look like KN bet trade on in the replay there as top eorts will secure themselves to Drake as well remember that Drake would have been so for theg there's just no way for them to realistically contest top orts on the map at this point with a z center with on items now spreading across the team I feel the clock is ticking for blg and to be honest the clock might have already struck midnight it's feeling a lot more like that so blg will need to find a way to turn back time we will see if their knight in shining armor who has carried them so many times in the past can be that Implement of time travel has three items on y he catches the carries great many things can happen it's hard to get through that verdant barrier on cream I think that banshe is a fine decision it's quite hard to get through that one of course it's very very hard to survive if the counter engage comes in from Top eorts at the same time Knight has such a burden of difficulty on him but it really feels like it is on him maybe on elk hitting an arrow as well but I think Knight with all of the gold whiches had been gifted to him this game needs to do the damage if they want to turn back time they don't need a knight they need a doctor let's see if his screwdriver is Sonic enough being Behind Enemy Lines and Jack love caught the combo is gorgeous they find Cen as well B setting up to deny the rest of the team away in the Hostile takeover is enough it's 369 that takes down his jungler and now blg Chase for more turn back time they absolutely have the 80s hit is coming back to life once more and maker will fall to make it fall blg find a miracle somehow someway blg find themselves the fight that they were looking for SP on the teleport Knight hits the ultimate and on with another Stellar hostile take over to add into the Wombo Combo blg we were wondering what had happened to this team were they just taking us a bit of a stage off just sleeping through the group stage just until he gets to that Rumble well they seem very truly awake right now cre has the last Baron buff to try and wave C it's not going to be enough to save this turret blg will at least take something they AR sadly taken in here it's not going to be the hugest swing in the history of mankind but it is something B fantastic teleport I think that top eorts they overstayed and they didn't do their due diligence making sure that those Wards were stepped out behind them and this is one rare moment but jaul doesn't have the cleanse catch him out one of the carries is done bin buys up the ultimate of course Knight gets the big damage onto Tien which sets up for a bit of a team kill there Order 66 called out and uh 369 he is the one that takes him down bring down the hammer indeed TN unfortunately betrayed by 369 as uh shun H's getting a little Saucy in the follow-up play for just the moment but still survives does what's needed a lot of gold given over to blg there however like you say no inhibs taken no Drake was up no Baron was up and it means that we are still sort of in the same situation as we were before like the composition hasn't got any better I mean honestly incredible credit to Ben for making some kind of late game reded play that's really hard to do by the way it doesn't happen that often gets himself a fantastic play timed with the rest of his teams engages too I think that is the that is one of the real skill sets of a top tier top planer you have to be on the right position while the rest of your team engages particularly on the lower Mobility or lower engaged Champions as well like the renon in a late game scenario when you only have that slice and dice which can be a bit hard to to manage so blg they have a minute and a half until they have another crack at that Soul Knight may be looking for something in the S Side Lane blg will they be able to find themselves another big teleport it feels a little unlike watch out for those Vision Wards just behind top orts lines to give blg a better shot does feel like blg have control of vision for the time being with Drake sping in just over a minute they are looking to maintain that control Knight has TP but he's not even going to move up to top side he wants to be with his team he does not want to give any angle for a potential pick So speaking of those picks we do have uh double spell shields for the carriers of top e that makes it a lot harder to play around the arrow very even oh well that's one of them gone that'll help top eorts they are however though getting into the battle lines they have that fank Spears bristling at the front of it if they can keep that with their front line really protecting their carries and the spell shield surviving it is much harder for blg to find anything they need to make sure the late game center the late game is it are not getting Valu it's really hard to do that bar now spawning in 30 seconds top East will push out mid trying to keep their battle lines in order oh sh caught by a shock blast here should walk away with his life in the Primal surge tops him up again it's been two long years since top Esports managed to find a win against blg and they know it they can feel it they know they're on the cusp of at least a game win whether or not they can turn it into a series of different question but they've got to finish the job been on a deep deep flank once more Drake started up here blg only three on the SE Knight moved over towards the wave needs to rejoin his Squad B not on a for the time being needs to get over there in the meim T trying to get onto Shan who's zoning the neither jungle actually on the Drake for the time being 6K on the dragon Tien isn't in the pit and the SM comes down that's Martin soul for plg but can they find the fight as well gream forced to use his but Knight just dips back out as Mo escapes on the front line Ben walks away with his life how has nobody gone down blg get a soul and lose nothing it's a daylight robbery top e w will try and get a Revenge bar but there are double teleports from blg they have HP bars on shun elk and on they don't have the ultimate so top will feel a lot better about going towards this and they'll rush it down quickly n immediately jumps over the wall and gets a tag onto jaula bin Behind Enemy Lines blg could try and look for an ace they need to deny these Baron Buffs top Esports retreating on the top side of C CAU in the pit here but they turn onto bin bin forced away towards the rest of his team he can't get a flank on the Croc but maybe they can go mid but there's no minions the minions are in their own base blg deny nothing top orts they get the baron after all so no one dies somehow blg gets soul on top Esports get themselves the baron blg getting Soul really does help them in their ways throughout the rest of this game I think El can save the inhib the Vol is going to do some decent uh wave player there and the Cannons are luckily aggroed onto the minions so that will be a mid inhib that survives going back to this fight blg they make it very clear with this hostile takeover it is about securing the dragon they throw it out as a Ling tactic as shun goes in even though he is rooted he just says all right it's back it's going towards the dragon that's what I need to get they manag to peel back after this point I think KN is the unsung hero of this though drags Jack 11 cream backwards means they can't get up to follow beyond the damage I would have expected someone to die from blg because cre and jaula were largely on hit but honestly Knight saving the fight I mean The Observers are like hey look a ward but KN don't have TP so I'll be impressed if one of them can find a TP flank onto it but I like the play off that Ward CU TP much shorter cool down at this point in the game I'm not sure which one whether TP will come back up or if the ward will time out first guess only time will tell top eorts though with Baron and with a range Advantage as well wait never mind The Siege they're just going to go for kills instead on under the tower and he survives The Shield at the last second the shot BL is too short how the hell has he got out of that one three m dragons a mad soul in a dream he manages to survive without what cost one Tower down the rest of this bar buff going to be used to try and break open this other inhib in bot side the front line standing strong really hard to get through it as blg and as you pointed out earlier they don't have a Teleport this time to punish top eorts if they had over pushed Beyond Vision which they kind of have in this case cre is spotted on a ward right now so there is a chance maybe that blg could look for something those Wards giving them those bits of information to try and split apart this balance of top eastw might just give them an opening B is searching so hard to find a in this game but it just feels impossible to get behind top orts they're doing such a good job trying to Clear Vision they know that no TPS were up so they're not too worried about Wards behind him for now bin moves up to the top side he'll go clear that next wave he's headed towards Jacka himself I assume could be a stone plate actually we'll have to see but my goodness we are properly into the late game aren't we we're on the Cur for 40 minutes in this one blg top orts and it's going to distance I can't remember remember any game I've ever cast that has five or items in it meos at level 18 top Esports they're not about even in Gold they're about 5,000 gold ahead those extra stats are ones which you get beyond your slot limit in your infantry as well we're getting to the point where we're going to get zeph built Freddy built Berserker Rees I've barely even seen any of them blg uh they are going to be behind in those stats they do make up for in those dragons though Mountain Sal incredibly valuable when you have a jack show Jack show which increases your percent resist as well the mountain Sal is really benefit that as alongside the three man dragons the amount of stats which have been given across the team are largely quite even because of that he put it all in order again scaling Advantage you'd have to assume goes to top Esports with this composition blg already made one Miracle fight happen maybe it's possible he can never quite count this team out on he's getting real dicey with his positioning here there's a deep deep W this time TPS are coming back up this time there's a chance point though he got 6,000 HP to work with yep that is uh that's the OD which gets extra stats when you upgrade items all those items funnel back in or so much value top Esports still need to be afraid of over pushing again jackula is quite consistently losing that spell shield he needs to be careful about that no spell shield makes it much harder for him to play out he has however got himself 160 Souls that range is utterly absurd he is very very longrange at this point and all the extra stats will very much help blg potentially looking for the FL blank bin again hovering in the wings wants to try and find his way onto the back F I love this from Top eots though just use the center range you don't have to commit to anything anyone that's short range just play body block or play back while jaula takes down the inip 160 souls for jaul Love at this point this is a properly late game center right here three items and he goes for a red pot he knows he's not getting any more items this game he knows that this elder could lead to everything deep Ward from on an is doing a really good job actually of trying to find these TP Wards ready for his solo laners that is such a an important thing in high level gameplay you need to see what the sweepers can do as well T's going to spot that out but look Top SPS know the way they lose this is by one of these teleport PLS they should know that at this point there is one in lane and that's the thing it's not about getting them optimal Ward it's getting the ward which is least likely to get spotted and even then jackula anden they used those ping qus and they're managing to s I mean do they have a FL TP option now I don't think they do they have to go towards a minion that would be on Vision they go on Wave I think sh will get away with his life here that was Mo using ghost from Spellbook so don't don't worry about it Vision swept by top Esports off the back of the crab as Elder is on the map and blg have to try and stop top orts from finishing the game here supers will push down mid so the longer this engagement goes on the better for top Esports they've got sustain they've got range blg have to find something special here Elder will reset Cen goes for his ultimate but before the fight can even begin it's over shun kicked out bin gets into the B line but it's too little and it's too late Knight gets a shield B alone as the rest of the carry trying and get in Knight dives into the mix but he can't get it done and elf is alone in the woods and hunted by the crossbow top orts that is game one top orts reign supreme top e sport and blg into the ice Locker off the back of a perfect suadi ultimate the fight was over before it began the game was so so back and forth but top Beast was proving they are here to fight for it the fact the blg held on this long with his composition is impressive but top eort I mean they locked full scaling and they played full scaling fantastic clean gameplay coming out from them blg a fair attempt to check challenging but top eorts truly do look like the best in the LPL right now you know top eorts we called it pretty much from the draft you need to have early game advantages you need to get a certain level of a lead in this game and they very nearly did that and they very nearly outplayed it despite that that tells you just how good blg are when they on this kind of team fighting Menace team but they couldn't quite manage to get that to happen and top e was real credit to them I think they're showing one of their strongest points they are one of the most disciplined organized teams within the LPL and they might just give them the edge over blg how crazy is that as a said it's top orts is one of the most disciplined teams in the LPL you never thought those words would meon would you but here we are top eorts 1 Z we're going to jump into our break and then it's time for game two

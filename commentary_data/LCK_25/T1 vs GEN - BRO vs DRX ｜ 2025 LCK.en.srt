Chronicler here for his first cast back

150
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,080
from MSI. Uh and we're also looking

151
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,880
absolutely glorious in our orange and

152
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,000
blue. Uh I'm feeling a little bit more

153
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,440
uh safety oriented than you are. Um not

154
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,080
quite as bright as you could be there,

155
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
Chronicler.

156
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,559
I for one do appreciate that. You know,

157
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,320
it's my final season at the Oscar and

158
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,919
you are wearing the Dutch national

159
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,120
collars. That's beautiful. You know,

160
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,080
that's friendship right there.

161
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

162
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,240
That's exactly why why we're in this.

163
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,840
It's the Dutch national national colors.

164
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,840
That's And I knew that that existed

165
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,720
prior to this conversation.

166
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,240
Absolutely. It really did. Um Yeah. Uh

167
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,480
so we've got a bit of a surprise for

168
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,280
you. Uh I know that your last cast was

169
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
T1 versus Gen G over at MSI. And so

170
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,400
we've decided to give you something

171
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
very, very different.

172
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,960
Oh. We've got T1 versus Gen, but it's a

173
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,960
home stand

174
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,799
here in Korea, which is very, very

175
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,880
exciting. As you can see here, we are

176
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
starting off with the legend group for

177
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,120
the first time this week. It's been Rise

178
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,600
Beginnings. Um, so far over the last

179
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,720
couple of days, but the undefeated Gen

180
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,919
are up against T1 and they've played a

181
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,320
lot of games against one another. I

182
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,960
believe in MSI it was 10 games in a row.

183
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,720
Uh, at least for Geng it was in a row.

184
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,799
Um, and then, you know, they went off to

185
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,559
EWC. They had some video games over

186
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,000
there as well. Didn't quite cross paths

187
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,919
the same amount of times, but uh I I

188
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,880
don't see Genji's winning streak

189
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,480
finishing here today. I would not be

190
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,159
shocked if it ends up being another

191
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,720
close yet so far moment as we have seen

192
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,400
many a time for Geng. I just want to

193
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,360
remind everyone the last time this team

194
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,000
lost um that that was that was in in

195
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,440
February by one game as well by the way

196
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,400
which I feel like we don't often talk

197
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,760
about but that was also by just one just

198
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,440
one as the 2025 SK Road show the T1 home

199
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,480
ground big match that we're going to

200
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,559
witness here between these two teams T1

201
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,640
I think in the minds of many of us right

202
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,559
now actually the second best team home

203
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,840
life have not looked that good in recent

204
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,080
form T1 the fact that they got to MSI

205
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,799
was, if we cast our minds back, a bit of

206
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,840
a surprise. The fact they got two games

207
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,039
away from winning against Geng twice

208
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,640
kind of mind-blowing.

209
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,039
Yeah. Well, I I mean, I think it's

210
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,600
debatable cuz I saw KT play yesterday

211
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,360
and I quite enjoyed what I was watching.

212
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,120
I'm not going to lie to you. That is a

213
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,279
debate for another day, though, as it is

214
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,960
T1 versus Gen here today. And as we can

215
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,320
see, Genji have been doing a lot of the

216
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,440
most recent winning, and that's because

217
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,360
they haven't lost to anyone at all. um

218
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,960
you know since the LCK cup and first

219
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,760
stand and stuff like that happened after

220
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,000
that it was all Geng all the time. Are

221
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,880
you ready Chroy and always Faker is the

222
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,600
response between these two 63 to

223
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,000
I still can't I I can't believe that

224
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
literally the only that that one win

225
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,120
decided who won MSI like that's that's

226
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,440
that's not real. How is that how is that

227
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,000
a thing? How is that the life we're

228
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,840
living where literally that single game

229
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,559
difference between these two mid laners

230
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,600
ended up deciding the MSI? I It's

231
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,760
mindboggling. Atlas, it's insane. It is

232
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,520
absolutely ridiculous. And then over at

233
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,240
EWC, of course, they didn't actually

234
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,440
meet one another and so we didn't really

235
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,720
uh see too much since that MSI final. It

236
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,919
was the same patch, though. This is the

237
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
first time we're seeing them on the new

238
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,799
one. And now some walkouts here.

239
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,360
Starting with T1 and starting on the top

240
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,960
side, it is Doran owner going to be

241
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,640
joining him there in the jungle. And I

242
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,480
am looking forward to seeing a

243
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:51,360
revitalized T1 here

244
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,320
as the mid lane goat walking in

245
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,640
coming after I think for his standards a

246
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,880
pretty lackluster spring but did

247
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,559
definitely step it up again at MSI which

248
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,000
was very needed. Kind of a reverse of

249
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,600
last year. Uh, Gumushi Carry out. We

250
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,200
have talked about these players. We've

251
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,520
talked about this team for so much. The

252
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,520
introduction of Doran with the fact that

253
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,480
they made their first MSI finals in a

254
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,720
very long time, plus the importance that

255
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,480
he had in getting them there. I think a

256
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,039
cool reminder of how this roster has

257
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,440
changed. Obviously the fourman core uh

258
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,679
four of the most insane consistent

259
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,320
highlevel finishes that we have seen out

260
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,320
of really any group of players uh

261
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,520
perhaps in the LCK only rivaled by the

262
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,720
team that they're about to face up

263
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,039
against because that top side is looking

264
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,279
mean as well and for T1 what a big win

265
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,600
it would be even though it is just just

266
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,120
a legend group right it's just a regular

267
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,039
season win

268
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,960
you remember Atlas cuz I'm pretty sure

269
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,080
if I remember correctly it was you Wolf

270
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,480
that casted that that first round Robin

271
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,799
the one where Chovi cuz that game three

272
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,919
the the Chovy Victor moment that did not

273
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,600
feel like a regular season game.

274
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,240
Oh no no no no. Casting that was

275
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,039
definitely not a regular season. That's

276
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,520
not how it works.

277
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,120
That felt like we were at a semi-final.

278
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,559
Well that was not that was not normal.

279
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,559
And to be honest you know the matchups

280
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,720
between these two teams didn't really

281
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,200
change as we went further through the

282
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,679
year as well. So, it is pretty

283
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,120
incredible um that that's what we're

284
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,960
getting as we do have

285
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,080
a pretty exciting day on our hands. We

286
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,640
saw that is an absolutely packed arena

287
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,240
there as well over in Inchan. Um super

288
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,960
duper cool to see so many people come

289
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,840
out and it reminds me of a quote that

290
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,840
Geng had which is talking about having

291
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,399
to play against crowds that aren't

292
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,240
necessarily for them. Well, they've got

293
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,240
another test on their hands. I'm pretty

294
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,880
sure it is the T1 home ground. So, of

295
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,200
course, this one is being put on by T1.

296
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,080
But even if it was a Genji home ground,

297
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,600
I would expect a lot of T1 fans to also

298
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,679
be there and be very loud.

299
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,039
That's just the reality really. And this

300
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,240
is something we keep going back to. It

301
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,480
doesn't matter where we are in the

302
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,279
world. Legitimately, we've we've cost

303
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,039
this team in every region worldwide,

304
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,279
they will always be crowd favorite.

305
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,679
There just isn't a way around it. Uh,

306
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,000
and for Geng, particularly for Chrovis,

307
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,159
he's obviously been here since 2022,

308
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,240
right? Who has basically faced off

309
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,840
against his team an infinite amount of

310
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,120
times,

311
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,480
they're just used to it. That's just

312
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,399
that's just the reality. That's just

313
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,240
life as it is for Gen.

314
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,159
And the reason he's only just beaten the

315
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,200
headto-head as well is that, you know,

316
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,080
Griffin was consistently losing in 2019.

317
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,000
2020 didn't see much better things. 2021

318
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,960
was a weird year. And you know, it's

319
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,840
it's a story of Chovi making his way

320
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,679
back into into godhood after what was

321
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,720
such an extraordinary debut with his

322
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,799
what 126 KDA or something like that he

323
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,799
had in his uh large amount of

324
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,120
undefeatedness uh that he started off

325
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,320
with. And we are going to move in to the

326
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,679
introductions for Geng here, our EWC

327
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,000
winners as well as our MSI back-to back

328
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,520
champions.

329
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
This is uh another test that they're

330
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,880
going to have to pass here. They did

331
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,120
manage to get through HLE pretty

332
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,039
comfortably earlier in the week right

333
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,720
after getting off a plane. I don't know

334
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,320
what to expect after they've had a

335
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,000
couple of good nights sleep.

336
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,039
Yeah, we've seen people kind of go the

337
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,679
opposite way where they're like,

338
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,440
actually the enemy of Gen is breaks,

339
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,279
right? Like if you look at some of their

340
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,000
some of their performances after not

341
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,440
playing for like a week or two, uh I I

342
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
don't want to lean into the memes too

343
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,039
much,

344
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,520
but this Geng team and particularly uh

345
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,559
Chovi, right? What I love every time we

346
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,799
get the Chi versus Faker is how much

347
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,600
these two players clearly respect each

348
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,200
other and how Faker has been pushed by

349
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,320
Chi to become a better laner, right? Cuz

350
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,640
that's something that he used to bring,

351
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,559
but when we go back to when Chovi really

352
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,120
rose to prominence, that was his biggest

353
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,039
strength. whereas Chovi is watching

354
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Faker win a World Finals and he's like,

355
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,960
I need I need to be like him. I need to

356
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,640
be more clutch. So, I just love the back

357
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,320
and forth that we have between these

358
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,240
two. And that's always going to be the

359
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,679
core, right? Because let's be real, it's

360
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,200
the greatest of all time versus the

361
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,960
current best player in the world that

362
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,399
every thing that we talk about is just

363
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,640
going to kind of gravitate towards that.

364
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,880
Yep. It's just sort of how it is. And I

365
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,880
do want to like deviate from that

366
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,679
momentarily because I do think one of

367
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,000
the biggest reasons why Geng look as

368
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,559
incredibly good as they do is because

369
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,440
they got this random guy from Liv

370
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:34,640
sandbox and he's just super duper good

371
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,600
is absolutely amazing man. This guy has

372
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,960
just fit in with a team full of only

373
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,960
legends. It's I know it's the legend

374
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,399
group and blah blah blah, but these are

375
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,960
incredible players in their own right

376
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,200
that have built extraordinary legacies.

377
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,279
You know, the story of Keen finishing in

378
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,519
every single position, you know, before

379
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,919
he manages to get first. There's a story

380
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,279
of Ruler being world champion and then

381
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,960
taking forever to become a domestic

382
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,120
champion. We were talking about Troy for

383
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,039
a while. This is about Canyon trying to

384
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,440
rise back again to the prominence that

385
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,120
he found in 2020. Was toted as the best

386
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,240
jungler in the world, but then how does

387
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,159
he get back there? And then Duro, a guy

388
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,519
who just joined the league and then he

389
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,799
just hopped onto the team. He's like,

390
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,360
I'm going to be the new carrier. You

391
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,600
just watch.

392
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,440
Yeah. I

393
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,360
And so far,

394
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,799
literally the only moment where we felt

395
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,240
like it was actually going to be a big

396
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
issue was like what the first two

397
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,799
months.

398
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,880
We were we were starting in like April.

399
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,080
We're like, hold up, wait a minute. What

400
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,000
is happening? Yeah. And I think Duro

401
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,679
both in terms of gameplay uh but also

402
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,960
when it comes to some of the moments

403
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,480
that he had at MSI, I don't know if you

404
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,559
saw at the end where he just hold up the

405
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,679
hand and silenced the crap that you

406
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,200
you're not supposed to have that much

407
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,559
aura when you're the like the quote

408
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,320
unquote rookie on your team. Not

409
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,240
technically a rookie obviously did play

410
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,440
as you highlighted for a very short

411
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,799
amount of time,

412
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,519
but I think it also highlights what we

413
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,440
have seen from GenG in their ability.

414
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,320
They did this with the light as well as

415
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,640
we go back and yeah, it should come as

416
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,799
absolutely no surprise that Chovi is

417
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,200
leading in a lot of stats here.

418
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah. Um they haven't lost a series

419
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,519
since we started recording these stats.

420
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,240
So

421
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,679
um yeah, uh it's it's looking like he's

422
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,360
probably going to continue having pretty

423
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,960
good stats throughout the season because

424
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,240
we also haven't had a stat reset. It's

425
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,760
not like we've gone to the summer season

426
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,200
or anything like that even though it's

427
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,200
hot as heck outside. Um it is just sat

428
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,279
stats rolling through. So yeah, this is

429
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,240
um this is pretty unprecedented. Highest

430
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,919
DPM in the league. And the damage per

431
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,039
gold stats are really interesting here

432
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,159
because I think that's one of the

433
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,480
greatest stats for determining how much

434
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,159
uh you make use of the money that you're

435
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,519
given in every game. It's not just based

436
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,120
on how much you're winning, it's based

437
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,039
on how much use you get out of it. The

438
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,840
fact that these two have this the two

439
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,840
highest in the league really goes to

440
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,080
show why we always talk about Troy

441
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,760
versus Faker. But in in Chov's case,

442
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,240
it's actually even more insane cuz you

443
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,919
know how much gold he gets, right? Like

444
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,399
that that to me is what always gets me

445
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,000
with Chovi is that you know the leads he

446
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,960
builds, the leads that again cuz his

447
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,599
team just wins a lot. So being able to

448
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,119
still have that much damage even though

449
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,720
you are getting that much gold every

450
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,119
game I think is insane for Faker. I want

451
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,480
to reiterate I think that Faker has been

452
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,679
a demon in spring in 2023 in 2024. I

453
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,520
think this spring was actually

454
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,679
relatively muted. We were talking about

455
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,839
Zea. We were talking about BDD, not

456
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,520
about him. I think he did really step it

457
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,200
up when it comes to the impact that he

458
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,480
was able to find again, particularly at

459
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,960
MSI. Uh, but when it comes to going up

460
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,240
against Chovi, that is what Chovi has

461
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,320
been trying to incorporate, right? Like

462
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,000
that impact, what can he do? What are

463
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,879
the plays he can make? And how can he

464
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,040
impact the map?

465
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,079
And their final against anyone's legend

466
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,040
that we did see only a few days ago, it

467
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,359
was that game five that really I don't

468
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,440
know. It it I had that sort of moment

469
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,679
where I realized he's changed because

470
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,119
I'd watched him on DRX so many times,

471
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,960
pick TF

472
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,160
get so much gold and then just push top

473
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,040
lane and lose.

474
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,960
Yep.

475
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,280
That that did not happen this time

476
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,240
around. He got the gold. He did that

477
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,640
part, you know, 4,000 at a like what 000

478
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,040
score line or something like that ahead

479
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,800
of his opposition, but then won the

480
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
game. then was helping the rest of his

481
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,040
team, then was utilizing Destiny's to

482
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,800
make sure that everyone else was able to

483
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,240
get things done and and it really was an

484
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,920
eye openening moment as to the

485
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,240
development of this guy and the fact

486
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,000
that he's been able to transition

487
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,200
incredible individual play into being

488
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
able to win on the map as well.

489
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
And what I love Atlas is we've been

490
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,760
talking all this time about basically

491
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,760
just Faker and Chovy, a little bit of

492
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,680
Duro. We can have a

493
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,599
Yeah, we can have these sort of

494
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,160
about every single matchup. What about

495
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,440
the fact that Keen, who I think was the

496
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,280
tournament MVP when it comes to uh what

497
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,960
was it? MSI was, if I remember

498
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,079
correctly, the actual tournament MVP.

499
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,320
Yeah, VWC as well.

500
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,400
The fact that Ruler, who I think was

501
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,920
together with Duro, one of the slightly

502
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,760
weak spots,

503
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,720
that MSI performance was

504
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,680
it was crazy.

505
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,000
And the game five also in EWC as well

506
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,000
picks Zia and then just hard carries.

507
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,040
He's like, "Don't worry, guys. It's on

508
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,839
my shoulders now."

509
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Which Guma did in game four against Al

510
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,480
at MSI as well together as Rakan.

511
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
There's too many parallels. We're

512
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,240
skipping the draft. We're just not going

513
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,760
to talk about it. Um, you guys can watch

514
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,520
as the pretty pictures come up on the

515
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,800
screen. Wait a minute. We're going to

516
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,119
sling narrative. That's what we're

517
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
doing.

518
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,280
We haven't even talked. You mentioned

519
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,160
it, but 2020 DRX. That was Parador and

520
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
Chovi.

521
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,839
Oh my goodness. The amount of uh Yeah, I

522
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,760
mean, a lot of these players have all

523
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,160
played with each other. Of course, Keen

524
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
has taken Doran's position and things

525
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,200
like this. It's all just a bit all over

526
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,560
the place. But we do have some bands.

527
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,800
Let's have a chat about those, I guess,

528
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,240
as the Tia, the Aurora, and the Gallo

529
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,160
all going to be taken away. You could

530
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,160
argue that they are all trophy bands as

531
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,520
well, although the Aurora ban is almost

532
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,520
definitely angled towards Keen. And what

533
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,440
is left up? Annie, Vi, um the PV that we

534
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,240
were talking about on Wednesday, uh Wolf

535
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,800
and I is um the VI, Varys, and the

536
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,160
Pantheon. And the V is still left up,

537
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,720
but the Annie is going to be the

538
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,079
selection here for Faker.

539
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,680
I was wondering whether they were going

540
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,040
to go for beam on Gwen cuz the Aurora

541
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,760
has been one of the prominent counter

542
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,480
picks. This is also a highlight that

543
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,000
that I think the Viprow has slowly

544
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,599
started drop. I wouldn't be surprised if

545
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,280
Owner still picks it up here. He's an

546
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,440
incredible VI. It is really good

547
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,839
together with the Annie specifically,

548
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,520
but to me, we have seen the VI slowly

549
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,760
start to follow and Wukong is something

550
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,160
you pick into VI, right? because of the

551
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,760
ability to counteract a lot of what she

552
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,440
does. The clone is really annoying to

553
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,240
deal with. Again, wouldn't be surprised

554
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,520
if device still gets picked up here. And

555
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,599
what we also continue to see is that T1

556
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,359
is heavily prioritizing getting a

557
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,800
comfortable matchup for Faker. They've

558
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,000
been doing this a lot, bending a lot of

559
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,520
trophy champions and then picking

560
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,760
something that Faker's victory and blind

561
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,800
can be any. I imagine if we go to like a

562
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,839
game two, game three, we're going to see

563
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
the Well, we're going to go to game two,

564
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,480
but if we go to game three, we're going

565
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,079
to see the Victor as well. something

566
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,119
that they've been prioritizing for

567
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,280
exactly the same reason as a VI would go

568
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,400
well with these two champions. AD Fred

569
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,480
Zinszou could be another I I would have

570
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,400
also liked Trundle just because I love

571
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,400
Trundle Rumble. I know you can't see any

572
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,920
tanks on the other side, right? You

573
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,359
often try to pick it into tanks, but

574
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,960
Trundle's just been good.

575
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,880
It's just good.

576
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,400
I'm with you as this would have twofold

577
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,240
pressure here for Chovi. would be very

578
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,599
good into the lane match up against

579
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,119
Annie obviously having a lot of range.

580
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,000
I would have thought that Diana makes a

581
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,520
lot more sense but

582
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,040
I mean I would have loved that. I think

583
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,400
actually Diana is one of those champions

584
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,359
where we might start seeing her in

585
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,680
certain matchups. Uh just at any point,

586
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,920
right?

587
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,400
I think as soon as Kenan hits the rift,

588
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,240
that's when

589
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,920
Oh god, don't remind. What was that? Was

590
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,640
this Was this like his Gwen counter pick

591
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,560
and it was a disaster? He got solo bolo.

592
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,760
It was his Gwen countered pick. That's

593
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
what it was. It was a little bit

594
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,400
different.

595
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,880
Yeah, it's it's when you exchange the R

596
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,040
for the D and you really do struggle.

597
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,320
This is both a lane number pick for

598
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,079
Chroy, but it also picks away from

599
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,359
Faker, right? The Faker is one of the

600
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,880
players that still really likes the

601
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,359
Oriana, gravitates towards it very

602
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,760
often.

603
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,040
Yep.

604
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,160
So, you are able to take that away and

605
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,680
also it combines really well with the

606
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,520
Wukong filler. That's a no-brainer. We

607
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,119
have double AP solo lanes combined with

608
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,960
a heavy AD threat.

609
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,040
Yep. I'm seeing or is going to be very

610
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,320
upset. Uh because with double AP we're

611
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,079
not going to be getting a Ziggs. Not

612
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,920
this time around.

613
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,359
Yeah, Naidder. No one should be picking

614
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,960
Zigs here in this first game.

615
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,560
I don't think that's what's going to

616
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,320
happen. I think center is going to be

617
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,520
locked in by someone though unless it is

618
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,599
going to be banned away.

619
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,599
My guess would be yeah R for center here

620
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,920
if it isn't banned for Genji and then

621
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,599
they give counter pick to Duro. Genji

622
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,800
have liked just picking like Re. Uh I

623
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,880
think Real is also a good pickway cuz

624
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,440
Real Rumble and Real Vi obviously are

625
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,320
really big threats. You can just slam Re

626
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,119
or Alistar here on four and then give

627
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,760
the counter pick over to

628
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,440
uh to Duro. There is also the threat of

629
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,320
a Jin which I think that Gouma in

630
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,240
particular is going to be looking

631
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,079
towards. Both players have liked it but

632
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,760
for T1 it obviously doubles up because

633
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,440
Jyn is very self-sufficient in lane and

634
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,320
gives carry the ability to impact the

635
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,200
map.

636
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,440
There is the Alistar ban which feels

637
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,599
like they are fishing for a real here

638
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,880
like they want Jen to pick RA right

639
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,960
especially with an Alistister ban which

640
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,079
normally we see picked into the rail a

641
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,400
decent amount

642
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,480
and we also really like on the side of

643
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,320
T1 so it kind of fits if it is going to

644
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,480
be left up. I think the center is still

645
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,000
probably um the highest priority

646
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,280
champion that's sort of left up as far

647
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,280
as the roles that they're looking for,

648
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,359
but we'll see what ruler does decide to

649
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,880
go with as we are ticking down. It's a

650
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,160
Jin instead.

651
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,839
Feels like denial um rather than picking

652
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,880
for Ruler. They will be able to take

653
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,880
that one away from Gushi.

654
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,880
I' I've been I've been happily convinced

655
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
by Ruler's Jin. I also think that this

656
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,520
is the type of composition where it does

657
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,320
work well. You don't have a lot of

658
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,720
safety from your uh from your team so

659
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,800
far. It is eco

660
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,839
combined with the Oh my god, Duro.

661
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,720
Okay, I mean, if Duro's just going to

662
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,560
like sit here in like the the T1 home

663
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,800
ground and just aura farm everyone by

664
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,119
playing carrier's skin,

665
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,520
oh my goodness, that would be too much.

666
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,200
That would be going too far, my friend.

667
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,520
And

668
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,119
the the the funniest part about this is

669
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,079
if you told me if you took the name

670
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,160
plates away, I would have thought that

671
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,680
that Geng draft was a T1 draft. And this

672
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,880
is something that as we I think play

673
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,720
more and more Fearless, we're going to

674
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,480
see more and more of is teams just

675
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,079
trying to work on two levels cuz I think

676
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,280
this is a very good draft from Gen,

677
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,720
right? You have good lane pressure. I

678
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,440
think Bard works really well into

679
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,560
particularly the Rumble, the Annie. I

680
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,839
think those champions can really

681
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,200
struggle, even the Nico into the Bard.

682
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,880
But then add to that that you're also

683
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,400
picking away Gumayushi's Jin, right,

684
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,680
which has been one of his pick comp. You

685
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,839
pick away the Oriana.

686
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,359
For T1 though, I think that there is

687
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,800
this type of composition that just

688
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,960
really plays heavily around early

689
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,800
scraps. That's what they love. This is a

690
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,720
very chaotic team and I like that they

691
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,240
lean into it draft in the first game.

692
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,920
Yep. It's going to work pretty well, I

693
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,040
could imagine, for the beginnings of the

694
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,599
game. It's just whether it's going to

695
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,079
work well enough against uh Genji, who

696
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,000
are pretty good at just staying stable

697
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,240
and then playing for the team fights

698
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,599
later on. We've also seen that Oriana

699
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,520
can lack a bit of damage depending on

700
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,920
what the build is going to be. I think

701
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,160
my favorite was from Shanks a little bit

702
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,040
more recently, which was like shadow

703
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,040
flames and all sorts of mega damage

704
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,760
builds and items. And that sounds really

705
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,760
fun. Let's get into it.

706
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,119
I was waiting for some fan chance, but

707
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,640
we didn't get any fan chance. Do we miss

708
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,760
them?

709
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,760
cuz I'm I'm hearing chatter.

710
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,940
There's certainly some chanting going.

711
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,880
There we go.

712
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,440
[Music]

713
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,240
Okay.

714
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Okay.

715
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,440
That's a lot of T1.

716
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Okay.

717
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,920
Okay. Let's just not commentate. We can

718
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,920
just let the crowd do it.

719
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,119
No T1 crowds. This isn't going to stop

720
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,079
anytime soon either.

721
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,440
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I'm

722
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,359
like, hang on. How how long are we

723
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,440
supposed to hold?

724
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,200
Also, Duro is not using carrier's skin,

725
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,000
which is I think a little bit of a

726
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,680
bother.

727
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,119
That's okay. Chi could have also done

728
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,880
the same thing. He elected not to.

729
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,040
I wouldn't be surprised.

730
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,280
I want I hope that Ruler used ghost

731
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,040
skin, though.

732
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,119
The ghost jin is actually dope. That is

733
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,119
actually my favorite Jin skin. And it is

734
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,760
mostly because of Ghost. Let's be real.

735
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,160
He's just such a lovely. He's just so

736
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,079
sweet.

737
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,240
And I like just the, you know, the Greek

738
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,440
god theming of that skin line. I think

739
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,000
it's just cool.

740
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,400
And this is also uh the first time that

741
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Geng can get revenge uh sorry, the T1

742
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,839
can get revenge for GenG putting T1's

743
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,280
broken key in their trophy at EWC. Even

744
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,599
though they never faced off against one

745
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,319
another, they did the same thing to

746
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,839
Halife Esports as well. It was uh the

747
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,280
first time that that had happened and we

748
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,040
were trying to work out whether it's BM

749
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,119
or not. And I don't think that that was

750
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,319
the case. I know that it was Ruler and

751
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,160
Dura that were standing up there trying

752
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,960
to figure out what to do and that's just

753
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,960
what they decided to do. And I just

754
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,960
think it's kind of funny. So now we'll

755
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,160
see what T1 think about it in this early

756
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,240
game as the aggression is going to begin

757
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,880
hopefully shortly. We have had some

758
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,319
relatively late uh first blood.

759
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
It does give you and me the opportunity

760
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,480
to catch up.

761
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,720
It's true. It has been a while.

762
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,280
It has been a long time, Atlas,

763
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,680
cuz we always joke, you know, how how uh

764
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,040
it's always you and me wherever we go.

765
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,200
And then it wasn't. And it really

766
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,880
bothered me. I I I missed you a lot.

767
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,480
Yeah, I I was uh I was a bit sad not to

768
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,800
make it to Vancouver. Never been to uh

769
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,119
to Canada before, but we're glad to be

770
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,280
back. And now we've got a lot of time.

771
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,880
Also skipped out on you, so I we're both

772
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,920
here. That's what matters as uh I think

773
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,240
looking at the early draft setups here,

774
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,920
this is two compositions that do really

775
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,839
look to push the issue. As soon as we

776
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,200
get to level six, right when we get the

777
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,520
ultimates available for the Wukong, the

778
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,280
VI, the Yiani, and the Rumble, that's

779
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,560
when I do expect there to be a

780
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,240
considerable amount of action. But on

781
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,200
the particularly for Wukong, I don't

782
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,560
really think they're going to be looking

783
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,760
too much. We do have some summoner

784
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,839
trades here early on.

785
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,160
Yeah, Carrier actually being read by a

786
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,000
book. read like a book a little bit

787
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,240
towards his bottom side. Sometime

788
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,760
sometimes those those shape spplitters

789
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,000
can let you get away with some stuff.

790
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,240
Not this time around.

791
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,680
But it is sort of like it's double range

792
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,920
match up towards the bottom side of the

793
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,000
map. It's level six scaling junglers as

794
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,839
you mentioned before. Gwen Rumble is a

795
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
lot more even than it was in the past.

796
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,400
At least that's sort of how it feels.

797
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,079
And Oriana Annie, need we say more? This

798
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,079
is like season one.

799
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,800
Exhaust for Keane I do think. Yeah, he

800
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,200
did ping. So he did spot does know that

801
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,920
owner is there and this is a preix

802
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,839
Wukong so I don't know how much he can

803
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,880
really do maybe if the binding hit but

804
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,160
doesn't look like that's going to be the

805
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,760
case and both junglers going to be

806
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,400
trying to get a base in and yeah I think

807
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,000
particularly after we saw the continuous

808
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,560
nerfs to Rumble uh he still has a lot of

809
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,319
friend lane we saw some solo kills

810
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,480
recent yesterday

811
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,079
but particular with the exhaust unless

812
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,800
you get ganked you should be able to

813
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,000
just as Ke is doing here maintain a nice

814
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,839
amount of pressure. Ke did go for

815
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,359
conqueror by the way. We've still seen a

816
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,359
decent mix between that and the

817
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,359
crosswash

818
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,400
traded as Goomer is just going to flash

819
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,359
away.

820
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,160
Ooh, flash and barrier and he'll use as

821
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,760
well. So some positive trade here. Duro

822
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,000
playing aggressive on the bard.

823
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,359
Yeah, there are two corkies here and if

824
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,640
there's two corkies it's going to make

825
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,319
the cleanse not very useful. That's my

826
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,839
assessment. still very even when it

827
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,200
comes to the summoner spells. In fact,

828
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,520
three corkies. Never mind. It's

829
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,880
completely out of control here for T1.

830
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,560
As you can see, carrier taking a bit of

831
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,800
damage

832
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,880
by Ruler who is standing his ground. Got

833
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,640
the Brad moving away. There is a Wukong

834
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,920
making his way in and a VI lurking in

835
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,280
the area as well. We'll see whether

836
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,760
there is actually going to be any action

837
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,960
as the health trade certainly favoring

838
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,400
Ruler for the moment.

839
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,920
Yeah, I think both junglers just showing

840
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,000
up trying to

841
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,079
immediate cleanse making use of that one

842
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,079
shot. Carrier turns back but it is going

843
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,520
to be the deadly flourish avoided and

844
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,880
Gumushi carrier going to look for a

845
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,880
little bit of a back angle.

846
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,520
That would have been big if that hits.

847
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,119
Never mind

848
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,119
the pre six dive.

849
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,400
Yeah, holding on to it here as Gumushi

850
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,359
Nim Strike going to come on through. And

851
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,200
it's actually Duro that takes the kill

852
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,880
and the teleport is going to be in a

853
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,240
little bit late here by Doran does have

854
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,480
the equalizer available though. But they

855
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,240
just take a magical journey to safety as

856
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,480
Tibis gets a little bit angry. But so

857
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,880
does the orb. And now Chro is looking to

858
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,880
chase it up. Look at the flash forward.

859
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,599
And there is the flash in to follow.

860
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,640
Owner locks down the kill onto Chovi.

861
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,720
And it may have just all been a bait.

862
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,160
Beautiful bait there. Oh, can you Oh,

863
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,839
there it is. Okay, never mind. It's

864
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,760
going to be answered. And Faker did

865
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,200
indeed go down. I thought that actually

866
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,839
Faker had made it out, but he was off

867
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,000
screen and I just saw the fact that Ona

868
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:17,920
came in for the kill. So actually going

869
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,839
to be a big old trade up here for Geng.

870
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,839
If Canyon doesn't find that kill would

871
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,920
have been really big there for T1 able

872
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,839
to get both Chroy's flash which does

873
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,119
mean that particularly with level six

874
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,520
available for Vice soon would have been

875
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,000
huge. First though going back to this it

876
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,200
really is testament to the 2v2 prowess

877
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,200
of Duro and Ruler that even when they

878
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,599
are playing cleanse into this barrier

879
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,839
lane they're still able to maintain as

880
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,760
much pressure to set up for a dive. Pre

881
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,599
six womb dives just aren't that good.

882
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,160
And then here Chovi thinks he has an

883
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,520
angle on Faker. I assume the shield just

884
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,000
barely is enough as yet there's dead

885
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,400
again.

886
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,960
That's that's the cost of that flash. So

887
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,800
Chomi playing aggressive and getting

888
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,119
punished two times in a row now.

889
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,040
Yeah, that was a solo kill from Fo.

890
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,119
No, no, no. It was I think uh both Owner

891
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,119
and Carrier. Carrier definitely flashed

892
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,559
for it. Owner was shown up the assist. I

893
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,920
don't know. Maybe I don't know if he was

894
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,480
actually involved. I should see

895
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,079
he didn't get an assist or at least

896
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,599
No, I guess he didn't. I thought I saw

897
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,640
him in the kill.

898
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,800
Might have been around.

899
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,000
Oh, I It was Carrier pretending to be

900
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,960
That's definitely what happened.

901
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,200
Yeah, we're going to check it out one

902
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,960
more time. Yes, and indeed Carrier is

903
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,800
here going to make his way over. There's

904
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,640
also an equalizer. So, it's Doran.

905
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,119
That's uh who the other person was.

906
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,960
Oh, it's Doran. There you go. Uh but

907
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:42,000
nicely done by Carrier. Really good

908
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:44,480
punish. Uh really good punish by the

909
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,240
side of T1 to make use of the fact that

910
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,480
the Tro has that flash right like that

911
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,160
aggressive flash. Uh I think a little

912
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,520
over eager when you're Oriana even

913
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,040
though the solo kill which you didn't

914
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,200
get again was Canyon that secure that

915
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:00,160
would have been nice. You are Oriana

916
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:02,319
into Nico by an end. So

917
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,599
that summon is pretty valuable. Tib is

918
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,040
going to come back again and command

919
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,680
protect not really going to be saving

920
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,520
Chovi here. is going to be skirting

921
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,200
around. Keen here towards his bottom

922
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,359
side. Needs to be a little careful. That

923
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,160
health bar is getting toasted a little

924
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,640
by Doran as Tim is going to come on over

925
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,200
and stand as T1 will be able to take

926
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,720
down these grubs. And they've taken the

927
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,079
first dragon as well. So, this will be

928
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,559
the second objective that they're able

929
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,160
to lock down if they can indeed do so.

930
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,480
Owner making his way out. And that will

931
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,880
be two grubs going over to T1 and

932
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,559
another objective secured for them as

933
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,480
far as feats of strength are concerned.

934
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,839
One more kill, one more objective. They

935
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,599
will be able to upgrade some shoes. The

936
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,680
equalizer goes down, but the exhaust is

937
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,839
there from Keen, who's snipping around

938
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,839
the rip. Does have his needles out as

939
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,119
well, but Faker is making his way down.

940
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,720
And Keen has now just realized that he's

941
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,079
likely dead. Wants to be able to trade

942
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,119
this one for the kill against Doran.

943
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,119
Let's see whether he can actually get

944
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,079
there as Never mind. Faker just comes on

945
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,480
over, stuns him up, and will just walk

946
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,000
underneath the turret, hoping to deny an

947
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,760
assist to Doran or something like that

948
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,760
in case, you know, damage came in a

949
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,160
little late, but wasn't to be the case.

950
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,079
Ruler on the hunt. Don't think he's

951
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,599
going to find him. Looks like Doran with

952
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,599
a safe back. Not going to be found by

953
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,760
this Jin. Ruler not wanting to just

954
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,480
throw out his ultimate and risk just

955
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,960
wasting it. And that is a nice set of

956
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,880
counter punches here now from T1. I do

957
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,240
want to reiterate that I do think that

958
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,680
with this style of composition, they're

959
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,839
the ones that need to keep this pace

960
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,280
high. If you end up just playing frontto

961
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,079
back team fights, eventually I think

962
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,440
you're going to reach the point where

963
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,599
Genji is going to be really hard to deal

964
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,000
with because their targets will get

965
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,960
harder to burst down. Uh it does look

966
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,480
like Chovi is going for a uh more tanky

967
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,400
build which

968
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,400
makes sense given the comp might still

969
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,240
be dead though. He is uh his flash is

970
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,319
enough as Tempered Fate is going to buy

971
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,000
him a little bit of time um but

972
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,359
otherwise not too much. It does take him

973
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,640
a little while longer. Pop Blossom is

974
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,599
going to be invested. Roller comes on

975
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,880
down though and Tibis is angry but it's

976
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,599
still going to be T1 that are running

977
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,839
away from the bottom lane of Gen G. They

978
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,480
got their prize and once again I mean 03

979
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,400
on this Oriana. We've seen like better

980
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,440
score lines on an Oriana be a little bit

981
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,760
useless and so this is exactly the T1

982
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,760
game plan trying to take Chroy out of

983
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,359
this as much as possible and it's

984
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,440
working.

985
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,359
I really like the punish there is so

986
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,440
much CC and so much damage available on

987
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,200
the team between the Annie Vi and Eco

988
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,400
and they're just really consistently

989
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,079
leaning into it. It's not even like

990
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,520
Chobi is that far of his lane, right?

991
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,280
like he is just basically standing like

992
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,839
just beyond the wall.

993
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,880
Yep.

994
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:39,200
Uh that uh marks between the river and

995
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,119
the jungle as you can see here. Not like

996
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,760
he's that far up the lane, but it's just

997
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,680
a really nice timing here from Owner.

998
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,200
And even if Oner doesn't find him, like

999
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,440
in the flash, I think Carrier will

1000
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,359
always murder him. Uh regardless of what

1001
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,119
happens, attempted

1002
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,119
uh saved by Jor doesn't quite hit the

1003
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,440
mark. if he can fight people instead of

1004
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,280
just maybe that's enough but not going

1005
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,880
to be the case and then Carrier has to

1006
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,800
do his best as he will be very happy to

1007
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,200
do so for that kill.

1008
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,160
Yeah, I guess as well but shock wave's

1009
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,079
going to come down towards his bottom

1010
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,599
side as Joby I think is a little angry.

1011
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,200
They get the cyclone as well that is

1012
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,599
going to guarantee that the Annie goes

1013
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,760
down as Dor you got to stop this man he

1014
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,359
is just meep slapping everyone to death

1015
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,680
and I think some of the kills would be

1016
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,920
better on a Wukong or an Oriana. really

1017
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,760
would cuz he's not even if he was

1018
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,119
electrocute, you know, like give me that

1019
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,599
rapid fire cannon.

1020
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,119
I mean, he could still build a rap. I

1021
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,880
was talking about this just

1022
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,880
he should he shouldn't pivot. He he's

1023
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,960
got his redemption done, which is good

1024
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,119
for early fights. Chovi did finish his

1025
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,559
roa, so that's something. But I have not

1026
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,960
been the biggest fan of the ROA. I feel

1027
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,200
like the item after the nerfs just

1028
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,599
doesn't really hit the same impact. No,

1029
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,720
my read is that Chovi, he has a ton of

1030
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,640
damage in his team and he's also going

1031
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,079
to be just very far behind in this game.

1032
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,480
I say that it's 130 gold

1033
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,200
which uh he has been farming up a storm

1034
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,040
as often is the case. So despite all the

1035
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:04,000
attention that's paid,

1036
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,440
it is still only 130 gold

1037
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,880
which is kind of crazy.

1038
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,160
Yeah, sort of ridiculous. That is going

1039
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,160
to be feed of strength as well over to

1040
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:15,280
T1. I'm pretty sure yes it is. as that

1041
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,200
uh last remaining objective was taken.

1042
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,880
They take down the dragon. So T1

1043
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,800
upgrading some shoes pretty nicely and

1044
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,599
it's a cloud soul. Oh baby, you love to

1045
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,680
see it. Always T1. They're always so

1046
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,960
good at getting the cloud souls. Some

1047
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,640
needle work down here towards bottom

1048
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,520
side and Faker has just decided that he

1049
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,760
wants to get out and he will do so. But

1050
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,920
looking a little worse for wear as him

1051
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,760
and Tibers head towards top side. It is

1052
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,440
like a kind of cool two for one special,

1053
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,040
isn't it? When you're Annie, you get to

1054
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,160
teleport your bear up there at the same

1055
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,760
time.

1056
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,800
If Keen had an item, he would have just

1057
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,480
died. That was a little dicey, but

1058
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,119
wasn't a little.

1059
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,720
Will be able to make it out anyway.

1060
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,200
Oh dear, that could be 50 gold over to

1061
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,680
Choby as well. Maybe um playing Annie

1062
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,520
into Chobi himself is actually a bad

1063
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,400
idea cuz this puts an extra minion on

1064
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,920
the map for him.

1065
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,040
I think this movement Yeah, the movement

1066
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,359
by Ruler kind of gives away that owner's

1067
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,520
like, "Uh, can I take that?" Right,

1068
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,800
guys. All right. Well, Duo and Canyon

1069
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,119
are in here. They're going to get the

1070
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,839
cyclone out as Ona will get the alt in.

1071
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,920
Doran is following as Quen's in the mix

1072
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,359
and they're looking for the Rumble as

1073
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,960
well. Magical journey going to be taken.

1074
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,119
On will get taken down, but it's a

1075
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,680
double pop blossom. Keen is going to go

1076
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,760
down and Canyon nowhere to run. Duro the

1077
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,960
same situation. He's going to have to

1078
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,800
really find some magic here.

1079
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,359
Yeah, that is going to be the old faint

1080
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,359
flame splitter spitter. And down goes

1081
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,040
the bar. Toby's farming. Ruler's

1082
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,480
farming, but the rest of the team is

1083
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,520
dead.

1084
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,119
Yeah, Ruler walked up, ulted, got his

1085
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,480
kill, and I was like, "Ah, okay, I'm no

1086
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,720
longer needed here." And

1087
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,319
it's it's so cool because just that

1088
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,000
movement from Ruler, I think, gave away.

1089
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,079
So, Owner knows he's going into multiple

1090
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,160
people here. And they're timing it with

1091
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,920
the arrival of Nico while also making

1092
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,240
sure that Ruler can't actually join the

1093
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,240
fight. And then with the open door,

1094
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,760
they're able to at least get that kill.

1095
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,680
But when all is said and done, this is

1096
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,720
obviously a very favorable trade. Will

1097
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,240
be three kills, 2-1. And this is offset

1098
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,799
a little bit by the fact that Chobi is

1099
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,400
just in a lane unattended by himself,

1100
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,119
which is why when we look at the gold

1101
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,000
lead, we're going to see that basically

1102
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,920
sticking around the same mark.

1103
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,400
And also, we did just watch him kill

1104
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,599
Tibers as well. So that's another 50 in

1105
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,480
his back pocket. That's

1106
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,359
You are really

1107
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,040
I mean,

1108
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,559
you're locked in on the Tippers gold. I

1109
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,160
mean, it is just a lot of gold, man.

1110
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,079
It's It's worth the same amount as a

1111
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,520
Nexus.

1112
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,119
Well, I feel like with Nexus, there's

1113
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,760
other circumstances that make the Nexus

1114
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,760
really valuable.

1115
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,359
No, no, no. 50 gold that is worth.

1116
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,839
Well, no. I I know that it has that, but

1117
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,680
that's not why people aspire to take

1118
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:49,359
down a nexus. I would say

1119
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,839
that's not my point, though.

1120
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,280
Okay.

1121
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,880
I'm just talking about the monetary

1122
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,040
value of a Nexus is the same as pivots.

1123
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,400
I And you know what? That's true. You

1124
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:03,040
are correct. I I I have no further

1125
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,920
argument, your honor. Uh that's all I

1126
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,880
got. Um yeah, so that is a large reason

1127
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,640
why uh Genji are still doing decently

1128
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,880
well as far as gold, but you can feel

1129
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,359
that the tempo around this map is not in

1130
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
their favor. Right, T1 are still taking

1131
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,720
the things that they want. There's been

1132
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,880
no objectives really picked up for Gen

1133
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,040
throughout this entire game. And that is

1134
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,720
going to continue as here towards the

1135
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,799
bottom side of the map. What if we try

1136
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,720
to kill Thor again? Well, he's just

1137
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,319
going to al the wave. The cannon is

1138
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,520
going to come through with another melee

1139
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,799
and we're going to see whether we can

1140
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,559
kill him underneath this turret. Another

1141
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,839
cyclone does come in. Decoy going to

1142
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,920
help take him out there as the tempered

1143
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:39,599
fate will deactivate the turret. That

1144
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,119
will allow everyone to get out of here

1145
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,079
as T1. Yeah, they're going to throw down

1146
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,280
the Rift Herald and they're going to

1147
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:47,520
look for even more. A sacrifice of just

1148
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,760
a rumble for this outer turret is going

1149
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,359
to feel pretty good as now Keen dashing

1150
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,040
after Faker here. The flash does come

1151
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,960
out and now Faker is definitely dead.

1152
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,680
That flash was never saving him ever.

1153
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,920
And now you got a Rift Herald making her

1154
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,119
way up towards the top side. Shelly

1155
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,319
Shel's merry jaunt as we can see here.

1156
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,319
But I don't know whether he wants to

1157
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,960
charge the turret because he probably

1158
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:11,040
would die. Shel is just going to wear

1159
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,359
wear herself out and head back to the

1160
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,799
void.

1161
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,520
This game's a bit of a mess out there.

1162
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,440
It's weird, man.

1163
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,280
It's fun. I'm having a good time.

1164
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,720
I mean, it just feels like T1 have done

1165
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,400
so many things and then I look at the

1166
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,880
top of the screen and I'm like, yes,

1167
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,720
they've got two dragons, but it's seven

1168
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,599
to seven and Genji has a gold lead. Like

1169
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:30,640
why do they have a gold lead?

1170
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:33,680
Yeah, I So it's partially the farm. It's

1171
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,319
partially the ability to they get a good

1172
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,000
amount of plates. And when it comes to

1173
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,920
kills, it ended up being I think

1174
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,839
relatively I think it's 7 to seven right

1175
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,400
now. So nice dive here. The fact that

1176
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:46,000
Dory uses his uh ultimate there does

1177
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,119
mean that the mid lane turret falls. I

1178
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,280
think maybe otherwise he could have

1179
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,440
barely made it. All right, here's

1180
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,440
another little catch. As we can see,

1181
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,559
Keen was in the mist for a while, but

1182
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,680
the equalizer is going to come down.

1183
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,520
That's another kill going over to

1184
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,359
Gumushi. Did take a fair bit of damage,

1185
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,720
but not quite enough as now Doran in a

1186
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,319
little bit of trouble. But maybe Ruler

1187
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,599
is as well, but finally does get that

1188
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:06,319
last shot

1189
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,160
into the Rumble. Yeah, Ruler has al and

1190
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,680
they don't have a Rumble, so maybe this

1191
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,920
is going to be a dragon that T1 feel

1192
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,079
like they can give up. Just one cloud

1193
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,440
isn't end of the world.

1194
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,839
They don't really want to risk it, I

1195
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,040
don't think.

1196
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,359
Looking at the alts, they only have

1197
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,640
Faker's old available. Oh, they've got

1198
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:23,839
Kushi's old as well.

1199
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,880
Yeah, that Okay, well,

1200
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,480
I missed you, Chronic.

1201
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,760
That is true. Yeah, you haven't tilted

1202
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,720
me. Wow. I I I lost my Atlas resistance.

1203
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Everything gets to me.

1204
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,200
It's all too easy.

1205
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,920
Yeah, it's not fun for you.

1206
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,160
Just need to get your practice up.

1207
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,160
It'll be fine. Uh I do think that

1208
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,079
maybe look for Cheeky. Not going to do

1209
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,240
it even with the vision. I think that's

1210
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,440
that's fair. Uh they don't really need

1211
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,920
to go for this. Would have been good for

1212
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,359
T1 if they had gotten it. And I think

1213
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,880
the redemption actually ended up being

1214
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,400
pretty big in that fight, right? The

1215
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,240
fact that Duro has that available

1216
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,160
because if we look, Keem stays alive

1217
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,680
here for a lot longer than I was

1218
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,000
initially expecting. It's him opting

1219
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,160
into this, by the way. Yep. Uh just

1220
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,720
fully voluntarily, but because he stays

1221
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,640
alive for so long, the rest of T1 can't

1222
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,319
help with taking down Ruler. And then

1223
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,640
Chi finds a nice ultimate to bring him

1224
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:13,440
back. Ruler finds W. Suddenly, Doran

1225
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,359
goes down and a lot of were used in T by

1226
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,200
T1 in the previous fight. And I think

1227
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,119
they are more reliant on their ultimates

1228
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,400
especially when Ruler and Doro still are

1229
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,720
there. So Drake's going to go over to GG

1230
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,079
as Chovi. Is it a trap? Yeah, they're

1231
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,160
going in. Who's trapping who? As the

1232
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,000
shock wave is fantastic to deny Faker's

1233
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,440
approach and now owner is in a little

1234
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,079
bit of trouble, but he's continuing to

1235
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,839
go in. This guy has no fear at all as

1236
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:39,520
the rockets do start raining down and

1237
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:41,839
Gumushi will say cease fire everyone.

1238
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,079
They will acquies at least for now. Keen

1239
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:45,760
and Doran continuing to just one v one

1240
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,960
here towards the bottom side and Gushi

1241
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,480
will come back towards the mid lane

1242
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,319
because Ruler is continuing to shove

1243
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,520
that one out

1244
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:55,839
as are we going to go for it as Chovi is

1245
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,240
backing

1246
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:01,119
who is there it is canyon comes on over

1247
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,680
and that is two dead Chi just knew I

1248
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,200
guess Genji had all the information and

1249
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,920
T1 caught napping as we've got a little

1250
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,920
bit of a dive here as the equal

1251
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,760
that is not a dive that you could take

1252
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,240
beautifully played here by Doran But on

1253
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:18,960
the top side, it's a mess.

1254
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:21,839
And not even vintage Doran is enough to

1255
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,440
halt the acceleration of gold for Genji.

1256
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,200
I really thought that they knew.

1257
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,480
Wait, unless Gumushi is down here just

1258
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,520
killing Ruler.

1259
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,880
Thanks for the chocolate.

1260
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,319
And he's able to get himself out. Does

1261
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,240
have of course the ghost blade.

1262
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,160
Oh, I I want to go back to that. I

1263
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,680
thought that they spotted them. Like I

1264
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,599
actually thought that they spotted him

1265
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,280
uh spotted them going into the brush

1266
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,400
right there cuz I think for a split

1267
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,839
second we saw the play from Canyon. They

1268
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,640
clearly did it but that wouldn't have

1269
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:48,400
happened. Goes in with stealth. He's

1270
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,040
able to get the kill. Chovi selling this

1271
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,799
very well is what allows them to

1272
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,359
going on the edge of vision and then

1273
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:57,839
backing like that. That was very sneaky.

1274
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,680
Uh allows him to get the and then here

1275
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,599
Keen has been playing very fast and

1276
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,760
loose this game. really how I like

1277
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,040
actually shout out to Doran, right? So

1278
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,119
he uh

1279
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,359
a lot of work was actually dodged as

1280
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,200
well.

1281
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,680
So dodges he rocket belts forward which

1282
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,040
dodges the W. Then he dodges the second

1283
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,119
shot which would have slowed him and

1284
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,119
maybe gotten another shot and then he

1285
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,960
also is able to as you highlight dodge

1286
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,200
the needle work while simultaneously

1287
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,200
getting his off take down which is nice

1288
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,480
and which you see a little bump up.

1289
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,480
Yeah, a little bit of a dorm blip.

1290
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,640
Yeah, that's that's a dorm blip. Uh but

1291
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,079
then on the other side of the map,

1292
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,839
Canyon has been he's been gaming Atlas.

1293
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,079
Yeah, he's he's definitely been gaming.

1294
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:39,359
Uh 61 and three on the Wukong. And we

1295
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,839
saw yesterday um it doesn't take Geng to

1296
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:44,640
make to make Wukong look broken like uh

1297
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:46,000
Wukong when he gets ahead. Was it uh who

1298
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,319
was it that was playing uh playing

1299
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,960
Wukong yesterday? I want to say it might

1300
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,920
have been

1301
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,839
is a big it just looked broken. It just

1302
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,599
looked really ridiculous the amount of

1303
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,440
damage that he was able to do. Now is

1304
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,280
going to get started up as Geng looking

1305
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,280
for their second objective of the game.

1306
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,400
Oh, that's a late contest.

1307
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,920
Oh, they're looking for the angle here

1308
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,280
as Doran does have his equalizer back

1309
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,720
off cool down. This will be difficult

1310
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,160
for them to lock down as the equalizer

1311
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:12,400
does come in and it will be secured here

1312
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,559
by Geng. Good smite from Canyon.

1313
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,920
Although there was no real contest as

1314
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,319
far as that front is concerned because

1315
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,160
the buy was nowhere in the area.

1316
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,960
Genji will just uh secure the highway

1317
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,119
robbery and is a big deal buff man. like

1318
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,880
this this guy. It's no longer just like

1319
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,319
you know the pedal situation and stuff

1320
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,240
like that. You just get a whole bunch

1321
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,240
more.

1322
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,559
It's a big deal as you highlight. It

1323
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,319
also I think sets up nicely because that

1324
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:39,280
teleport being invested by Doran means

1325
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,280
that Keen can now get TO push out that

1326
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,319
top wave and then make his way over

1327
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,799
towards the contest on the drake which

1328
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:49,119
would give Genji another opportunity.

1329
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,720
And despite everything that happened in

1330
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,319
the early game and the best attempts to

1331
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,440
shut down, Chobi is currently sitting on

1332
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,359
a 2K.

1333
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,760
Yeah. Um I I didn't want to bring that

1334
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:56,400
up.

1335
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,000
Well, we have to.

1336
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,920
It's confusing.

1337
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,520
So, I think it's a continued like

1338
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,760
obviously the farm cuz it's almost 50

1339
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,680
farm at this point. That that is a big

1340
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,359
amount of gold. He's got I think two

1341
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,799
turrets. Definitely got uh definitely

1342
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,400
got the top side. I think it was there

1343
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:13,760
for bot as well.

1344
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,440
Uh let's say let's say three to four

1345
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,039
tibers. So, that's 200 gold right there.

1346
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,799
I hope I hope Yundo's back there

1347
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,599
somewhere counting the amount of tivers

1348
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,200
that were taken.

1349
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:25,599
The space is going to ensure that you

1350
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:27,920
know how many tak

1351
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,280
what it takes it takes six tibbers to

1352
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,039
make a kill.

1353
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,440
If he's killed six tippers then he's

1354
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,280
actually a one three and seven Oriana.

1355
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,440
Very true. Atlas

1356
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,799
just quick

1357
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,440
needs to win this fight. He need to get

1358
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,559
a top on Ruler or Chovi. Well, Keen is

1359
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,160
running away, but I don't know whether

1360
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,240
he's necessarily the target that they

1361
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,760
want to be going on. Can be slippery,

1362
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,039
although it has worked in the past. Now,

1363
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,240
Dur could be in trouble, but he's also

1364
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,520
not the target they're looking for. The

1365
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:56,160
equalizer is weird to say the least.

1366
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,760
And T1 now without that big tool. Bonita

1367
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,000
works coming out there. The pop is going

1368
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,960
to connect on a new shot under four

1369
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,280
people. Oh no, five. My god, the

1370
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,839
cyclone. And they all explode. It is

1371
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:11,200
over as Genji, they'll take a

1372
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:15,319
celebratory dragon. And oh god, T1, that

1373
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,319
is not where you wanted to be.

1374
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,839
That's a bad movie right there, baby.

1375
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,000
That's what that was. That was a fiveman

1376
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:26,240
shockwave.

1377
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,319
I was like, surely it's not five. My

1378
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,280
brain just refused to believe that that

1379
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,680
was five people standing in perfect

1380
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,440
position to be blended.

1381
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,599
In in theory, it makes sense. It's like

1382
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,200
Gwen doesn't have an escape. Ke has been

1383
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,720
Keen has been playing like a psychopath.

1384
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,680
If we burst him down, we can maybe play

1385
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:46,240
the game. And I do think T1 need to play

1386
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,480
for these picks.

1387
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:51,039
The equalizer being used early, maybe a

1388
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,359
little scared, but then the whole

1389
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:55,039
sequence of the fiveman ultimate into

1390
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:58,720
the Duro ultimate and then

1391
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:00,880
into the just wandering over

1392
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,280
whizzes them up, you know, puts them

1393
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,319
into the food processor.

1394
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:10,319
Uh, we got to see this again as Keem

1395
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:12,960
goes in. It actually is

1396
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:15,520
Oh my god,

1397
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,440
Durham. It's a point blank.

1398
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,280
And then just the flash cyclone. No way

1399
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,200
to react. They're all just in the sky as

1400
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,720
soon as they come out of being golden.

1401
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:27,280
And they are whisked up. Oh my goodness.

1402
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,720
Well, if there is any doubt about Genji

1403
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,960
being in winning position in this game

1404
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,200
before, it is gone now as that is a

1405
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,799
guarantee. 8,000 gold now. the lead at

1406
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,960
24 and 1/2 minutes.

1407
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:38,480
So, this uh provides me with a great

1408
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,880
opportunity to ask Atlas.

1409
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,920
Yes.

1410
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,960
How you've been?

1411
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,440
I've been pretty good.

1412
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,039
Yeah.

1413
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,480
Yeah. Not too bad.

1414
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,799
It's Korean summer, you know. It's a

1415
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,319
lot.

1416
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:49,520
Yeah, that's uh it's not great. Faker is

1417
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:51,280
dead. Um and T Who did it go to? Canyon.

1418
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,240
Canyon. Unless it was trophy. They were

1419
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,440
they were sharing some

1420
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,280
the flank.

1421
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,280
Okay, there is a flank.

1422
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,640
Chronicler is not wrong.

1423
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,640
I just don't know whether you want to

1424
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:03,799
flank five people as four people. I

1425
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,799
don't think

1426
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,640
uh in fact that's a nice possible

1427
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,920
finding. If only there was another shock

1428
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,079
wave there, Troy, as that would have

1429
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,920
been an easy one on two, but instead

1430
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,240
So, back to green summer. It's it's

1431
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,160
rough.

1432
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,920
It is. It is real rough. We've got a

1433
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,920
really nice air conditioner, though. So,

1434
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,400
that is uh that has been put through its

1435
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,599
paces.

1436
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,599
That is the most important.

1437
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,359
Yeah. And so, that's definitely good,

1438
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,760
especially with my wife pregnant at

1439
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,039
home.

1440
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,000
I've been eating your uh your cold

1441
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,359
noodles.

1442
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,200
Cold noodle. Oh, I haven't had many on

1443
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,039
that much. That's actually something

1444
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,920
that I should be uh picking up here.

1445
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,960
Yeah, we're going to check out the

1446
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,079
replay

1447
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,720
and there were people Faker was alone.

1448
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,559
He was dead.

1449
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,359
One Faker and four Geng members.

1450
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,520
Didn't go so well.

1451
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:50,000
And despite the start, this Annie has

1452
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:51,839
really been uh after I think having both

1453
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,920
great early impact in the lane as well

1454
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:56,960
as in the side lanes able to find some

1455
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,720
plays even towards Keen. uh not being

1456
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,160
allowed to really play the game.

1457
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,160
There's a flash in. That's going to be

1458
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,160
another cosmic binding. Doran taking

1459
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,319
some time being CCed and will get caught

1460
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,400
by the very edge of that tempered fate.

1461
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,079
I've seen other ones of those miss as

1462
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,599
Keen is going to snip him up. It is now

1463
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,200
going to be Keen versus the bottom lane,

1464
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,200
but the pop loss going to do nothing

1465
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,799
against the stasis that he brings out.

1466
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,080
So that means that owner is going to die

1467
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:21,600
as well as everyone is zoned away. And

1468
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,000
ladies and gentlemen, this game is over.

1469
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,640
It is it is just not it's not really

1470
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,560
there's a 4,000 gold lead for the monkey

1471
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,560
um as we can see there and not even that

1472
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,239
outer turret is going to be secured as

1473
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,480
Genji are going to look for the Baron.

1474
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:36,960
Information is given over as T1 are

1475
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,880
looking for a miracle here and that is

1476
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,640
precisely what they're going to need.

1477
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,239
Well, that can definitely bully them up

1478
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,920
there like Chi needs to walk all the way

1479
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:45,839
over. They need to hurry up though.

1480
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,279
You see definitely Kane is on a flank

1481
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,279
angle as Carrier could be in a little

1482
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,199
bit of trouble here as Duro going to be

1483
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,319
cleansing himself. The deadly flourish

1484
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:54,400
comes down. There are the curt there's

1485
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,440
the curtain call as Canyon gets out of

1486
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,480
the pit. This baron is so

1487
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,719
extraordinarily low. It's down to 1,100

1488
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,080
and it's going to be secured by Gumushi.

1489
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:06,000
He's in the back of the pit and just

1490
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,440
gets sliced up like a ham. And it's

1491
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,279
going to be Ruler that takes that kill.

1492
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,120
Now Carrier wanting to keep at least

1493
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:16,159
another one of these baronss alive as

1494
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:17,920
Canyon comes boop. And down goes the VI.

1495
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:19,600
That was actually an eco.

1496
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,040
Does it again. If the game state was

1497
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,640
even remotely close, that would have

1498
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,560
been huge. Uh it it doesn't really

1499
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,839
change the

1500
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,719
equation. It still helps the the gumi

1501
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,560
narrative though.

1502
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:33,920
It it is he can put that one on the list

1503
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,520
as well. So what I want to highlight

1504
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,520
here, I actually like this call from T1

1505
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,640
cuz you're in a desperate situation,

1506
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,480
right? And you tpd to bot and then they

1507
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,400
started Nash, which means that Faker

1508
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,080
knew he could TP to mid and pressure

1509
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,920
them off the Baron. I think they were a

1510
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,839
little slow. They probably could have uh

1511
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,080
gotten a little bit more done.

1512
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:53,520
Ruby went gold, then Doran went gold,

1513
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,360
and then Doran went dead.

1514
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,360
I just don't think it really matters for

1515
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,520
the game cuz even with the Rebel Baron

1516
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,719
power play, it's it's 500 gold. It's

1517
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:05,120
probably going to be maybe a thousand if

1518
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,800
they're lucky by the end of it. Maybe it

1519
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,560
just stays around this, but they are not

1520
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,960
going to be able to contest the drake. I

1521
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,760
think it might be a negative.

1522
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,800
Um could be. Yeah,

1523
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,000
is that's that's my sum summation of how

1524
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,600
it's going to look. This carrier is

1525
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,920
going to limp away from that one.

1526
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,280
He's five level. How is we haven't

1527
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,640
really talked about the levels yet. How

1528
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,760
is ruler level 16? Um,

1529
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,080
it's a really good question.

1530
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,920
And then and then owner is is 14 and so

1531
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,320
is

1532
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,320
one heck of a of a buff.

1533
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,199
It is. What is it? It's so it's 39

1534
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,360
pedals for Geng. And we got to keep our

1535
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:43,360
eye on the Yeah. Where where's the I

1536
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,080
can't see the pedal counter. Oh, do you

1537
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,400
have to look at the character?

1538
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:49,440
No, I I looked at the character.

1539
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,440
I like the pedal counter that we had.

1540
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,679
Equalizer is used here towards the top

1541
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,960
side. And then yeah, this was the chobby

1542
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,320
golden Doran golden.

1543
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,239
Yeah, you got to flip it, right? I like

1544
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,920
Doran being that far up when you don't

1545
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:01,920
have control of your jungle. Obviously,

1546
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,040
most likely backfires. But I think at

1547
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,880
this point, if you're T1 and you're

1548
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,280
like, ah, we're looking at next game.

1549
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,560
Losing on blue side though, bit of a

1550
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,080
rough one. And again, a lot of good

1551
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,360
champions have already been taken away

1552
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,120
by Genji.

1553
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,120
It's a very good point. One thing that

1554
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,840
we did learn though is that even though

1555
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,679
Genji have already qualified for Worlds

1556
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,400
as of their last match,

1557
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,199
which is

1558
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,040
they are not looking to slow down um at

1559
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,480
any point in time. They could take a

1560
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,600
vacation if they felt like it and they

1561
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,520
would still be there for the world

1562
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,360
championship as they have made playoffs

1563
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,719
of the LCK already as Chobby is going to

1564
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,400
throw out his ultimate but only onto

1565
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,239
Owner and then just runs away. He has

1566
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,280
phase rush and is going to get pop

1567
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,239
blossom. They're going to see whether

1568
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,320
they can take him down, but he goes

1569
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:44,400
golden. The tempered fate to make people

1570
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,920
even more golden as finally is going to

1571
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,520
get taken out, but unfortunately the

1572
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,679
trade I think is going to be a little

1573
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,480
too great. That being said, killing

1574
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,840
Choby probably feels great. Um, and

1575
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,880
that's the best they're going to get

1576
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,719
because their nexus is about to explode.

1577
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,840
Hey, they got six stacks off of the

1578
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,000
Madax as well.

1579
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,640
Oh, that is a really good point. Um,

1580
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,320
Faker is it's curtains does manage to

1581
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,040
almost take down Canyon here. That was

1582
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,480
very close as Carrier is likely going to

1583
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,760
get booped. That is a decent little

1584
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,520
captain Jack there from Ruler, but

1585
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,199
unable to quite kill him. And so Carrier

1586
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,760
will be able to watch on as his nexus

1587
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:22,080
goes down. But T1 will drop this one.

1588
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:23,679
Genji looking poised to hit that number

1589
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,600
28.

1590
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,920
Two main characters for me in that one.

1591
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,440
Uh, on one hand, the monkey. Uh, I've

1592
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,159
been talking a lot about monkeys for

1593
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,719
obvious reasons.

1594
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:35,040
Monkey. Yeah, but big monkey performance

1595
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:37,199
there uh from Canyon. The other one is

1596
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,280
Duro. The This is something we keep

1597
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,080
going back to with this player

1598
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,600
just locking in a champion and more and

1599
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,920
more champions that he's added to his

1600
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,159
champion pool. That game five pike from

1601
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,520
MSI I will not forget.

1602
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,719
It's not something that he's known for.

1603
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,719
It's something his opponent is known

1604
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,800
for. And his Bart performance was crazy

1605
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,960
in this game. Was able to make a huge

1606
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,440
impact. Really lean into the creativity

1607
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,360
that Bard allows you to have as well. I

1608
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,280
I just think that that play in the river

1609
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:05,199
was one of the greatest that we've seen

1610
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,440
ever. And of course, Chobi finding the

1611
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,239
shock wave was the biggest one.

1612
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,600
But

1613
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:11,440
it's how it comes together.

1614
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,040
Yeah. And the followup, the fact that

1615
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,199
the Tempered Fate was there to make sure

1616
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:18,159
that Canyon was set up for

1617
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:20,080
just absolutely exquisite. And you can

1618
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:22,880
see, yeah, it was already drifting

1619
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:25,120
towards Gen. And that cliff you can see

1620
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,400
there, that is um

1621
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,360
that's a fiveman. That's that little red

1622
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,159
A there.

1623
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,600
Yeah,

1624
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,120
cuz we knew before and cuz that's

1625
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,120
highlighted. I think that Genji was

1626
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,880
always going to have T1 on a timer. I

1627
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,080
think their 5v5 is just insane with this

1628
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,840
composition. I just didn't expect it to

1629
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:44,159
happen like an item and a half in.

1630
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,840
No, I didn't either. Really impressive

1631
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,679
stuff here from Geng. They've been

1632
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,199
impressive for a very long time. T1

1633
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,440
though, they have been stalwart. Let's

1634
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:53,600
see whether they can sort things out,

1635
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,239
get back on the horse, and bring us

1636
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,960
three games because T like Genji, they

1637
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:00,880
often go the distance in their series.

1638
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,600
So hopefully they're generous here for

1639
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,480
the LCK Road Show, the T1 home ground,

1640
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,320
they give us a full three game. We have

1641
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,760
short go for a short break when we get

1642
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,760
back. The space going to break that one

1643
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,760
down.

1644
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:17,239

1677
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:59,360
Hello and welcome to the space. We are

1678
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,920
here after game number one of Genji up

1679
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,760
against T1 and that one was kind of even

1680
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:06,400
for the early game, but eventually

1681
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,080
Chov's shockwave found them all and the

1682
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:11,040
game kind of just ended from there. I'm

1683
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,400
Valdez. We do have Wol and Wadid joining

1684
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,800
us today. How do you guys feel about

1685
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,239
that game number one? It was a pretty

1686
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,080
close game at the beginning, right?

1687
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:20,159
Faker had a great laning phase. A lot of

1688
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,000
resources were given to him. He baited

1689
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:23,760
uh them into that that play in the mid

1690
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,360
lane. Was able to get a kill there. The

1691
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,520
Annie looked like it was going to get

1692
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,840
online and the team composition here for

1693
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,159
T1 from ahead is so hard for Genji to

1694
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:34,159
play into, but they made a few mistakes

1695
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:36,719
after the early game and Genji just ran

1696
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:40,159
away with it. This kind of has been a

1697
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,920
trend for so many teams that nearly stop

1698
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:43,920
Genji's streak but aren't quite able to.

1699
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,840
Yeah. Uh we just want to mainly focus

1700
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,600
about the Anie because now it's

1701
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:51,280
considered as one of the best pick in

1702
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:53,360
the mid lane. Uh the record is 50 not

1703
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:56,320
considering this game. Uh it was first

1704
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:58,239
uh lose on the Annie, but uh it was not

1705
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,880
the Annie's fault uh because Annie is

1706
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:03,679
one of the strong game power spike pick

1707
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,520
because that's what all it matters in

1708
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,520
this meta cuz you want to stack all

1709
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,920
drakes and any is just really strong

1710
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,239
until uh three items. The three item

1711
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,400
power spike is just insane. And also

1712
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:17,040
it's so easy to set up with the fight

1713
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,280
with any because it's just target CC and

1714
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,639
there's not many counter plays against

1715
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:24,560
any W flash. So that's why uh T1 could

1716
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,719
snowball the early game, but they just

1717
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,679
messed up around the the first highlight

1718
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:32,080
because they just didn't fight with any

1719
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,719
and it's OP, but what's the point if you

1720
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,000
don't fight with it?

1721
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,080
Yeah, they took the skirmish the wrong

1722
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,679
way. They took it the wrong way. And we

1723
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,800
can take a look at some of the early

1724
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:40,239
highlights. Let's take a look at

1725
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,080
highlight number one. Actually, 12

1726
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:44,960
minutes in, we had this fight in the

1727
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:47,920
jungle of T1 that owner seemed to know

1728
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,080
about and went head first into ends up

1729
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,159
being a win in the end for Gen. They

1730
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:54,320
don't have any setup here and Owner

1731
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:55,920
knows this as you say Valdez and just

1732
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:58,159
because you know doesn't necessarily

1733
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,520
mean it's the right play. Don't forget

1734
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,120
also that during this play even though

1735
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,480
it ends up being a trade here for T1

1736
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,719
where they do end up picking up a double

1737
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,880
for GMA. Joy is also free pushing on the

1738
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,320
top side and Vaker is just simply not

1739
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,639
here. So this is where a lot of the

1740
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,800
tempo is actually lost for T1 in this

1741
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,880
game despite the Corki getting two kills

1742
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,880
there. Genji gets so much space. They

1743
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,280
get so much control over the map. Yeah,

1744
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,120
even though they uh chain Gento the mid

1745
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:23,760
lane, I feel like Canyon was always

1746
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,760
ahead in tempo. I think just because of

1747
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,000
the bolt lane matchup, I feel like Corki

1748
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,800
Nico should have priority cuz Vi was

1749
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,199
covering in the early game uh flows, but

1750
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,239
I feel like them messing up the B boat

1751
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:38,480
play was kind of uh bad news for Vi cuz

1752
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:40,560
he was not able to get the tempo back

1753
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,800
against Ukong. And I think that causes a

1754
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,760
lot of issues in the map control here.

1755
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,600
Yeah, it absolutely did. And uh not 3

1756
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,600
minutes later, 15 minutes in for

1757
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,920
highlight 2 here. The bot dive did come

1758
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,440
through for Gen G with just added insult

1759
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,960
to injury here in this early game.

1760
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,800
This one is the most egregious one for

1761
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,239
me because you know the game state right

1762
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,639
like Carrie is here trying to cover but

1763
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:02,719
gets cut off. Look where Canyon is. He's

1764
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,080
like doing topside scuttle or something

1765
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,320
and ends up going mid and trying to make

1766
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:08,000
a play there. Just completely gone,

1767
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,840
right? They end up getting the the

1768
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,360
successful dive there taking Doran out

1769
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,719
and then making the play top side

1770
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:15,520
getting a solo kill. Canon's not

1771
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,280
involved in either play and Genji went

1772
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:20,000
on both sides of the map as Faker gets

1773
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,080
soloed by Keen and Ruler's just chilling

1774
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,159
like he doesn't have a outer in mid but

1775
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,679
he's so far back that the play Canyon

1776
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,679
looks for there in mid just doesn't work

1777
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,840
out and it's just better play it's a

1778
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,199
jungle uh gap here in in this first game

1779
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,520
in owner right for those

1780
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:35,440
yeah sorry canyon is the one making a

1781
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,120
successful player is the one who's you

1782
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,440
know on the top side and then trying to

1783
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:41,600
make the play in mid well then we had

1784
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,679
the highlights to rule them all which

1785
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,880
was one of the best highlights maybe all

1786
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,800
year we're going to get. This was

1787
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,920
highlight number three where Chovi's

1788
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:52,320
shockwave finds them all quite literally

1789
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,360
as everybody just grouped up for it and

1790
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,159
he knocked them down.

1791
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,400
Yeah, I feel like uh Genji was just well

1792
01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:00,960
spread around. That's why uh they were

1793
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:03,199
kind of it was really hard to find the

1794
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,960
the angle for the team fight for T1. So

1795
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:07,840
that's why they kind of hard forced the

1796
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,840
fight here. But I feel like uh just

1797
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,400
Genji in general, they just know where

1798
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:15,040
to position themselves and I I I think

1799
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,800
just in general uh they just had the

1800
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,639
better plan in the team fight and the

1801
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,600
better plan makes better plays here.

1802
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:21,679
Yeah, I mean that was one of those

1803
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,120
skirmishes. Obviously the fight that

1804
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,040
Valdez was talking about was the big

1805
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,719
shock wave with the Bard ultimate

1806
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,480
layered on top and then the Wukong

1807
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,600
ultimate, right? This composition works

1808
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,440
incredibly well when you have map

1809
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,560
control. We don't have the highlight

1810
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,719
visually to show you guys, but if you

1811
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,560
guys go look back at that play, Karia

1812
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:39,199
gets a engage, right, just like he did

1813
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,560
in that play, and it baits T1 in to a

1814
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,920
really rough spot, but they don't know

1815
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,920
where everyone's standing, right? They

1816
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,080
don't have full vision. And it with

1817
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,520
comps like this, I think vision and pryo

1818
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,800
is way more important than gold. You

1819
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,480
look at the gold graph in this game, for

1820
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,400
most of the game, it's relatively close,

1821
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,480
but Genji had so much control that the

1822
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:56,639
team fights were so hard to play. And

1823
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,920
Genji continue with their streak here.

1824
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,840
They're going to get the first game.

1825
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,679
Will they continue with another series

1826
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,280
win? Let's find out going into game

1827
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:05,679
number two. Back to the casters right

1828
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,360
now.

1829
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,520
Thank you very much, gentlemen. Yes. Uh

1830
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,639
that highlight was actually deemed too

1831
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,520
brutal to be shown once again. Once was

1832
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,400
definitely enough.

1833
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,800
It's too much.

1834
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,600
Y

1835
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,880
we already played it once live and then

1836
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,920
once in the replay.

1837
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,040
That was enough, I think.

1838
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,239
Yeah, we're definitely not going to see

1839
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,880
that on uh

1840
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:27,360
the Mad Movie like for the next like 15

1841
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,000
years. Uh yeah, there's I think the Mad

1842
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,760
Movies might actually just continue um

1843
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,320
as well. We'll just have that one in

1844
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,920
every Mad Movie from now on. Uh is how

1845
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,080
it's going to go. I'm looking forward to

1846
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:40,000
the score esports um putting out. No,

1847
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,280
it's not. It's It was against Faker,

1848
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,280
wasn't it? So, they probably won't make

1849
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,920
a video about that one.

1850
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,920
You're on fire today. You're not just

1851
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,360
starting fights. I'm not I'm not

1852
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,480
starting fights. I'm just I'm just

1853
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:54,239
observing a trend, okay? There's no

1854
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,000
there's no beef. I've worked with the

1855
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:58,719
score many times. Plus, are you familiar

1856
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,960
with the concept of rage baiting?

1857
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,639
And this is a rhetorical question

1858
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,280
because

1859
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,199
I have

1860
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,920
obviously I don't have any idea what

1861
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,760
you're talking about.

1862
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,639
On the experiencing end of your rage

1863
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,239
baiting for the last 4 and 1/2 years, so

1864
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,239
I know that you do

1865
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:16,159
for a fact. I feel like you're getting

1866
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:19,040
with every passing year, you're adding

1867
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:20,480
more tools to your arsenal. You know,

1868
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,840
I like to try. You know, you got to you

1869
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,320
got to add to the repertoire over the

1870
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,719
years. It's it's how it goes. But this

1871
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:29,920
is of course the T1 home ground at 2025

1872
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:32,080
LCK road show and T1 needs to win a game

1873
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,480
to give us value.

1874
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,199
Come on.

1875
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,360
That's all we need, right?

1876
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,320
I want to we want to we want a game

1877
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,480
free, right?

1878
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:42,239
And it's very red in the stadium. So I

1879
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:45,360
put this to you. Maybe it's time to

1880
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:47,280
choose red side because maybe what Geng

1881
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,520
thought was that everyone there because

1882
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:52,159
it was so red was cheering for them

1883
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:55,120
because they were on the red side.

1884
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:56,159
What do you think? That's my theory.

1885
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,440
Do you know what we didn't get? We

1886
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,639
didn't get account.

1887
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,880
Actually, I have a actually we didn't.

1888
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,960
Yeah. Very upsetting. I have a very Do

1889
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,400
you How good do you think noise

1890
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,040
cancelling headphones are?

1891
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,480
Not great.

1892
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,600
Okay. Well, in that case, I don't think

1893
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,520
that Genji is thinking.

1894
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,440
Well, no, no, no. So, not I think noise

1895
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,880
cancelling headphones are fantastic and

1896
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,719
they've definitely improved throughout

1897
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,920
the years. They're not good enough for

1898
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,639
that for an arena.

1899
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,920
You can see on your screen.

1900
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,840
Well, no, that's my point. So, they will

1901
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,360
know cuz every time team one does

1902
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,360
something, I assume there will be loud

1903
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,159
yelling. Yes, I imagine that there will

1904
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,480
be a fair bit.

1905
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:28,880
I hope we get free games of loud yelling

1906
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,639
because I love that. That's what we do.

1907
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,560
Exactly. We just got to do some more

1908
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,080
loud yelling. Okay, we are going to dive

1909
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,520
into this draft here. As you can see,

1910
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,199
it's fearless. So, we're not going to be

1911
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,199
seeing any more of these shock waves,

1912
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,880
finding them all. Instead, it will be

1913
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:42,719
once again banned on Tia. Last time

1914
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,120
around, it was Tia, Aurora, and Gallo

1915
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:46,639
taken away. And on the side of Genji,

1916
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:49,520
they took away the Pantheon, the Varys,

1917
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:53,120
and the Azir. I assume they're likely to

1918
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,719
continue uh down this trend as the Azir

1919
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,719
definitely needs to be banned given the

1920
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,159
fact that the Tia has been taken away.

1921
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:01,280
But instead, it's going to be a Zenzou.

1922
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:03,040
So, the Aurora up and available

1923
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,560
if they would like to take it. And of

1924
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,159
course, if they wanted to play things

1925
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,920
like the Rumble, things like the Gwen,

1926
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:11,440
that's why you ban the Aurora, and now

1927
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,280
feels a little bit less necessary.

1928
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,520
Still do think that Aurora is just in a

1929
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:18,320
good uh place right now if you have the

1930
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,760
execution. I do I don't think it's uh

1931
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,520
really a type of champion that you can

1932
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,400
just plug and play into any comp. I

1933
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,080
think it also requires funnly enough I

1934
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,600
think it requires good execution, but if

1935
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,440
you do, I do feel like the champion has

1936
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,159
very little counterplay.

1937
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:34,080
It's one of those champions where the

1938
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:37,080
things you can do with it if you're good

1939
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,080
feel

1940
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,560
because of the displacement on many of

1941
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,600
her abilities allowing her to always be

1942
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,480
out of way as

1943
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,679
I already wrote in Azia but instead it's

1944
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:50,880
Javin.

1945
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:52,800
So they're going to B1 Air and then Chi

1946
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:55,199
going to like what's like slam Victor.

1947
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,320
Oh it's it's a Y game. I can feel it.

1948
01:29:55,199 --> 01:30:00,080
Oh Suani Yon. Yeah, it feels it feels

1949
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,440
like it's down those lines

1950
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,199
that I think those are the two avenues.

1951
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,360
We're either going to see like Akali,

1952
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,280
Silus, or Yona, or we're going to see

1953
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,320
Victor. Um I

1954
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,080
I hope it's not Victor.

1955
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:13,760
I hope it's not Victor. I really don't

1956
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:17,120
think that that matchup is any anywhere

1957
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,719
near as good as people have seemingly

1958
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,639
thought it is. We are obviously

1959
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,880
People have been trying to like that

1960
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:24,159
snake oil has been on sale for so long.

1961
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,040
You know, people keep buying it out.

1962
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:28,880
I know. And and we every time we every

1963
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,719
time we we mention, oh, you got to be

1964
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,320
careful because you'll get you if you

1965
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,800
don't have flesh, you'll just get to

1966
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,120
die.

1967
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,360
It's like your people and those tulips,

1968
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,199
you know, it's the value is only there

1969
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:41,120
if the people say it's there, you know,

1970
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:43,120
and then you create a bubble and

1971
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:45,520
economics crash and it's just a

1972
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:47,679
disaster. And you'd think that history

1973
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,520
would have learned, but it didn't. Okay.

1974
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,120
Which is what happened in Japan.

1975
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,320
That's why we have a sear versus victor

1976
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,760
in 2025.

1977
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,400
That's what I'm saying.

1978
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,560
Yeah. Very very very upsetting. Um,

1979
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:01,360
you're the one. You're the one wearing

1980
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,520
orange. This is all just out. That's why

1981
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:05,280
I have the Netherlands on the mind.

1982
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,400
Oh, Zyra.

1983
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:11,199
I do love me. Oh, I do love me some Guma

1984
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:13,040
carrier Zyra. That is that is good

1985
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:14,800
stuff. I do think it's obviously a hard

1986
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,239
match up in lane. There is a lot of

1987
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,639
pressure that will be applied by the

1988
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:21,199
Lucian Braum. That being said, I mean,

1989
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:23,520
this T1 core that they've put together

1990
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:25,280
now can be augmented by so many

1991
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,360
different things, right? Like you could

1992
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,440
throw whatever kind of potato you want

1993
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:33,480
on the top side of the map, especially

1994
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:33,480
with the jungle already behind

1995
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,600
aren't going to be coming out from the

1996
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,080
side of Geng. They're probably going to

1997
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,520
have to away.

1998
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,840
And in fact, it is going to be the first

1999
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,000
one.

2000
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,360
I'm going to say Trundle Poppy. I think

2001
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,880
those are the two bands. I think the

2002
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:49,760
puppy also goes really well with the

2003
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:51,199
Azir. T1 is really good at using it even

2004
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,159
though they can't flex it. I think it's

2005
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:56,719
also good into the Scarnner. So, I would

2006
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:57,120
really like for that to be the takeaway.

2007
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,520
Yep.

2008
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,040
Now, I don't think T1 should ban

2009
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,960
midlaners here cuz I don't actually

2010
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:05,280
think it really matters what Chovi

2011
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:09,120
picks. I think that last game also

2012
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:12,159
showcased that trying to target Chovi is

2013
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:13,600
maybe not the way to go cuz I it didn't

2014
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:15,360
work at all and it was a lot of

2015
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,880
resources invested and it was obviously

2016
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,719
not really bothered.

2017
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,880
The Aurora is going to get taken away as

2018
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:24,000
mention I think Aurora is just top tier

2019
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,520
pick right now. She is just good.

2020
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,719
And I wonder whether you know the lack

2021
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,639
of Sichuani that we're seeing on the

2022
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,360
side of Genji will deter Chovi from the

2023
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:32,880
Yona angle and will make it so that T1

2024
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,800
doesn't necessarily have to ban that

2025
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,560
thing away as the knock turn is going to

2026
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,600
be the other band. So that Poppy you

2027
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,080
were talking about,

2028
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,960
okay,

2029
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:42,639
is still going to be there and playing

2030
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,080
Lucian into Poppy just doesn't feel very

2031
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:45,760
good. Outside of that, I guess you're

2032
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,159
not too worried. Although stand beside

2033
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,239
Braum is going to be a little bit uh

2034
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:52,080
more difficult.

2035
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:55,360
We'll see what tier one do decide to go

2036
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:57,360
with their final ban.

2037
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,880
Will it be something like a Yona? They

2038
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,960
wouldn't be representing very much magic

2039
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,800
damage at all on the side of Genji. So

2040
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,360
likely that that is not going to be a

2041
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:08,080
look and it will instead be the Hay

2042
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:11,120
taken a way. I actually like that. I

2043
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:13,679
think playing Zia into Hi is just a very

2044
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:15,760
miserable experience.

2045
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:17,280
Victor, as mentioned, I think has a lot

2046
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,120
of innate weaknesses that just won't

2047
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,880
make you super happy to lock it in.

2048
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,520
other things that outrange Z. We're

2049
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,880
talking like mid Zigs. We're talking uh

2050
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,960
I think it's Acid in game.

2051
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:30,880
I could I could see that. I think you do

2052
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,800
have to wait till five though. Keen

2053
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,000
Sante just slam it.

2054
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,639
Or we just play TF.

2055
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,040
Oh.

2056
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:41,440
Uh he is fresh off a nerf uh on this

2057
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:43,280
patch, but it wasn't exactly, you know,

2058
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:46,320
backbreaking. And I find it kind of

2059
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:47,679
crazy, right? cuz I feel like TF is one

2060
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,520
of these champions that's just never

2061
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:51,440
going to be that good in solo queue

2062
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,920
anymore just because as soon as you're

2063
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:56,239
good at it in pro, it's like ridiculous.

2064
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,360
So, the fact that it even got nerfed is

2065
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,960
just kind of nuts.

2066
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,679
I'm pretty sure he was also in the zero

2067
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,639
win club.

2068
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:04,000
He was in the zero win club until game

2069
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,840
five EWC final.

2070
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,560
Yeah, I know. And then he did kind of

2071
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,920
and then everyone figured out why he was

2072
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,000
being

2073
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,040
I I want to I was at MSI. I should

2074
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,639
remember this, but I feel like either

2075
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,320
Chroy or Faker did pick it up at some

2076
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,679
point and did really well with it, but

2077
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,000
it was like one like basically the

2078
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:21,760
champion was like one in I think Kalista

2079
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,440
was winless and then

2080
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,159
TF maybe had one played by T1 and Geng

2081
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,120
at MSI.

2082
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,400
That would make sense.

2083
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,360
Both of them. I don't know whether it

2084
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,320
was uh

2085
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,840
successful or not

2086
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,159
that successful or anything like it was

2087
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,159
pulled.

2088
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,880
I know the sentiment was that uh people

2089
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,480
didn't like it.

2090
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,800
Jace

2091
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,719
Jace Okay. And some range. I like that.

2092
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,199
one of my least favorite Sajuani

2093
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:45,679
compositions. Although at least now does

2094
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:48,159
work. Um, but otherwise we're going to

2095
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:49,760
hope for some hammer form here from

2096
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:51,199
the Jace. And yeah, we're not

2097
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,679
representing a lot of damage on the side

2098
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,679
of Genji.

2099
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I've

2100
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:58,159
fallen for this trap before. The the Oh,

2101
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,840
Genji doesn't have that much damage.

2102
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,199
This is where you're allowed to say it.

2103
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,560
You're allowed to say it now in the

2104
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:04,239
draft. Okay, cuz

2105
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,159
and then when the damage graphs come up,

2106
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:09,040
you're like, "Ah, well, you know, I

2107
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:11,120
guess uh Casante is actually a damage."

2108
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,400
So, let's let's The T1 draft I think is

2109
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:14,000
very straightforward. This is an amazing

2110
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,280
team fighting draft. You have decent

2111
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,520
amount of pressure towards the top side

2112
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:19,920
of the map. I think that what you need

2113
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,400
to be careful for is early on. I don't

2114
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,320
think your like uh early skirmishes are

2115
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,239
quite as strong cuz you have Braum and

2116
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,480
Lucian which are crazy good and then you

2117
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:29,440
have the TF, right? So, I do think you

2118
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,719
need to be careful about how you

2119
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,080
navigate the early game. can really

2120
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:34,560
easily fall behind if you take a couple

2121
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,840
of bad skirmishes. When it comes to 5v5

2122
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,080
though, this comp is absolutely

2123
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,760
devastating. Has great range, has great

2124
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,320
damage spread, has a lot of playmaker

2125
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,880
potential, has good engage, has good it

2126
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,880
has everything.

2127
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,480
Yeah, self- peel as well for Gushi is

2128
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:49,840
fantastic. Although when rapid fire

2129
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,560
comes in for TF being a Zia just feels

2130
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,199
terrible.

2131
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,800
This comp for Genji, if it was any other

2132
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,199
team, I would think it sucks.

2133
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,800
Yeah,

2134
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:58,960
I would just be like, I don't think you

2135
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:01,040
have damage. I think these champions

2136
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,840
just they can be okay, but I feel like

2137
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,520
we're really lacking.

2138
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,639
Do you know what the the best part is?

2139
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,480
Exhibit A is the entirety of MSI,

2140
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:11,920
except when it's Genji.

2141
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:13,520
Exactly. Exactly right. Um so yeah, I'm

2142
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,199
I'm also not sold. I would agree with

2143
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,280
you. I think that uh Chroy's Twist of

2144
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:19,440
Fate is built well and truly different

2145
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:21,840
and has evolved over time. This was our

2146
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:24,159
example earlier on in the day for a

2147
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,920
reason. And we'll see whether we're

2148
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:28,639
going to look silly with pie on our face

2149
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:31,360
after T1 bring us to a third game or

2150
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:36,040
whether it's Genji just continuing the

2151
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,040
uh trend towards 28 in a row.

2152
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:41,040
There was yelling earlier.

2153
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,719
Yeah, I just thought that maybe this

2154
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,440
time around we'd get there, but we just

2155
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,280
didn't get there. So,

2156
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,880
it's okay. It's okay. We still had the

2157
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:49,280
yelling. It might have been that we had

2158
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,280
them like earlier on or something like

2159
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,440
that. Or maybe there's like a time time

2160
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,199
difference scenario.

2161
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:57,840
I'm not entirely sure.

2162
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:58,800
It's fine either way. I don't need fan

2163
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,199
chance. All right.

2164
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,760
I actually uh I made a post about this

2165
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:05,920
as well during MSI. So there are for me

2166
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,159
say that you the classic scenario like

2167
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:11,280
aliens are invading and we need we need

2168
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:13,119
a we need a setup that wins us a 5v5

2169
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,440
league game against the aliens,

2170
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,920
right? And there were two duos that I

2171
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,920
named.

2172
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,760
So it's kind of like the

2173
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,199
base. Yeah. Yeah. Basically like who

2174
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,480
would you want when your when your life

2175
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:26,080
is on the line when everything comes

2176
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:29,280
down to it. One of the combos was Guma

2177
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:32,800
on Za carry on cuz I've I've seen them

2178
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:35,119
do trulant

2179
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,920
with Kenyon Nidley.

2180
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:39,440
That's a pretty good one. Um now we

2181
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,119
don't have the Nidi so I'm a little

2182
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,719
worried for Genji. It's really what I

2183
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:44,480
was kind of heading towards.

2184
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,639
Yeah. I I didn't quite know where you

2185
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:48,800
were going, but you did get somewhere.

2186
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,280
Um the whole alien invasion thing really

2187
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,440
threw me.

2188
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,639
Have you never Have you never seen that?

2189
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,600
It's like a very common

2190
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,360
Space Jam. Yes.

2191
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,520
Well, no, but like the sentiment of

2192
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:00,639
everything is on the line, who do you

2193
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:03,760
ask to, you know, if I'm so like in Game

2194
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:07,119
of Thrones where like uh Tyrion asks for

2195
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:09,119
um for a second comes in

2196
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:11,280
if I if I was arguing about League of

2197
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:13,280
Legends minutia, I would pick as my

2198
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,080
champion. And I know I, you know, like

2199
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,199
in that way.

2200
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,679
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

2201
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:19,199
That that's kind of what I'm

2202
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:21,199
what I'm leaning towards. If I needed

2203
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:23,520
someone that would make an argument for

2204
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:24,320
why Blast Con suck with a Brenda fellas

2205
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,960
right there.

2206
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,320
Yep. I do think that Faker being on Azir

2207
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,199
is also a pretty good one.

2208
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:34,320
That's maybe that's all you'd need.

2209
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:35,920
And honestly, T1 has a large selection

2210
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,400
of things that they're pretty used to

2211
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,080
playing. Um, Onus Suani has been up or

2212
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:43,360
down as Canyon is going to pop into this

2213
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,360
top lane to pay Doran a visit. See

2214
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,800
whether they do get a flash and they do.

2215
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,400
So Doran is going to make his way out,

2216
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,159
but does have to use a pretty important

2217
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,600
summoner spell. Now Kane going to be

2218
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:53,280
feeling much better in that lane.

2219
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,040
Although he wasn't feeling great earlier

2220
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:57,840
on. Bit of a drive by here by Owner as

2221
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:59,520
he moves towards the top side. Has

2222
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,600
cleared out his entire bottom side. And

2223
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,080
it is going to be now up to Canyon to

2224
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,719
head towards his bot side jungle. See if

2225
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,080
Kane is able to use that.

2226
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,600
The early level's going to be really

2227
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:12,480
rough. Post six, you obviously have a

2228
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,880
lot more kill threat, so should be

2229
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,400
looking better afterwards. Canyon

2230
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,719
actually interesting popping here. So,

2231
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,400
full topside player into attempt to gank

2232
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,679
towards top. Doesn't actually get the

2233
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,960
wall slam. That could have been the

2234
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:24,960
difference maker between actually

2235
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,080
getting a kill, but without that not

2236
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,880
going to be the case. Still gets the

2237
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:30,639
flash and isn't really that far behind.

2238
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,560
Is about like a camp behind, I think,

2239
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,239
when all is said and done. Yep. Although

2240
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,960
as I'm looking isn't doesn't even look

2241
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:40,800
like that's really the case. Owner also

2242
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:43,199
showing mid earlier on as we do have

2243
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,280
Canyon now done with his Gromp. And as

2244
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:48,000
expected, Thor and Ruler should have

2245
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:51,040
cryo in his laning phase for uh the

2246
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:54,080
foreseeable future unless we see anyone

2247
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:55,840
on the Genji bot side mess up. There are

2248
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,920
a lot of spell books as well. Want to

2249
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:01,760
highlight that. So we have the supports

2250
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:03,440
as expected. Then we have TF as well as

2251
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:05,360
Owner as oh Faker.

2252
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:07,199
Yeah, Canyon going to pop on over but

2253
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:08,400
doesn't quite get his claws into the

2254
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:11,520
pigeon.

2255
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:14,400
So Faker will be able to back away.

2256
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,080
Owner secures the crab. Crab answered on

2257
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:18,080
the bottom side. And Canyon actually

2258
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:21,360
waiting a little bit before he takes his

2259
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:23,199
blue buff. You can see it is still up.

2260
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,719
So only going to be popping over now

2261
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:27,119
looking for a little bit of an entry

2262
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,159
towards Chovi. We'll be able to find an

2263
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:29,360
angle. We'll see whether they can

2264
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:31,040
actually get a flash, but Canyon's going

2265
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:33,199
to move on over. And now they get the

2266
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:36,080
gold card onto the Siguani just to make

2267
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:39,840
sure that uh these red dots can continue

2268
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:43,199
to be consumed by Chovi stacking that

2269
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:45,040
deck over and over again. As I do love

2270
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:47,679
that as soon as Chovi won that game on

2271
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:49,440
the Twisted Fate, everyone learns all of

2272
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,040
this intricate stuff about TF just

2273
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,560
because he was making so much money. The

2274
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,119
fact that now they understand that

2275
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,480
loaded dice is actually loaded and

2276
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:57,840
they're like, "Why does he keep getting

2277
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,639
six?" That's because that's kind of how

2278
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,320
the champion is supposed to work.

2279
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:03,760
Look at that face and tell me that that

2280
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,840
doesn't look like a man that you would

2281
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,520
not want to play in a fair card game.

2282
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,080
Cuz there won't be a fair card game,

2283
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:12,000
Atlas.

2284
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:13,520
Yeah, it's Channing Tatum. Absolutely.

2285
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,199
You didn't watch uh the most recent

2286
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,679
Deadpool and Wolverine movie?

2287
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:18,880
I have he he played um what's his face?

2288
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,840
Never mind. Got a bit of an engage here

2289
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,920
towards the bottom side of the map.

2290
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,199
Ruler dashing on in. But carrier gets

2291
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,400
himself out of there. We do have the

2292
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:26,480
feathers pulled back, but no one's going

2293
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:28,480
to get rooted. So I believe this will be

2294
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,679
a stalemate. Do get the concussive blows

2295
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,840
onto owner who takes a fair bit of

2296
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:34,480
damage but everyone on Geng is looking a

2297
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:37,600
little worse for wear. I think now it's

2298
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,639
time to pull this one back as okay never

2299
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,080
mind. We are coming in for another

2300
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,679
engage. Canyon looking for a bit of an

2301
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:44,800
angle there. Throws a rock around but

2302
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:46,320
otherwise it is not too much.

2303
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,920
Good amount of action there towards the

2304
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:50,320
bot side of the map. Going to be

2305
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:53,760
favorable for Geng. The summoner trades

2306
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:56,320
actually going to benefit them as they

2307
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:59,040
only invested the heal where T1 had to

2308
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,880
invest flashes for both GMA and Carrier.

2309
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:03,760
Yeah, kind of crazy that the flash

2310
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,440
exchange was that bad for T1 as Toby

2311
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,440
throws out a gold card in mid.

2312
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,440
I think the the big thing was that Gmba

2313
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:11,520
tried to get the recall and build,

2314
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:13,679
right? Like if he gets the recall, that

2315
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,920
mean they kill ruler, but he uses flash,

2316
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:18,880
wasn't forced, was a voluntary and did

2317
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,560
end up costing. And if you had have got

2318
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,480
RE's flash for it, which is often what

2319
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,920
you get going for those plays, it could

2320
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,920
have worked out. As Flash does come on

2321
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,360
through, Choby utilizing his as well.

2322
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,960
Feels a little bit less punishing when

2323
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,960
you can exchange that for a new summoner

2324
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,199
spell. The teleport comes in from Duro

2325
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,800
making his way back to lane. Feels like

2326
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:36,159
it's a more action-packed early game,

2327
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,639
but we've had less kills. It's kind of

2328
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,560
interesting.

2329
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,000
It's been Canyon. Canyon actually been

2330
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,159
one of the biggest criticisms we've had

2331
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,239
for him for a long time is that he is

2332
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:46,320
just not that active as Oh, Keen.

2333
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:48,719
Yeah, owner going to get that flash.

2334
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:50,400
Nice. And Doran's just about to come

2335
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:53,360
back off cool down as well. So a kind of

2336
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:55,520
big deal as the Jace will have even a

2337
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:57,600
flash advantage on top of the fact that

2338
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,360
he is having a real good time in lane.

2339
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,800
So Canyon's been very active with the

2340
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:03,119
biggest piece of criticism for Kang

2341
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:05,040
obviously often is that isn't that

2342
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:07,040
active, but he's been matched by Owner,

2343
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:08,800
right? Owner was there in bot to counter

2344
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:11,920
the gank timing. Owner now forces to

2345
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:14,719
flash towards top side. Also has been

2346
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,040
hovering around mid. I I we are seeing a

2347
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:19,600
bit of a problem developing though,

2348
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:21,440
which is that as you highlight like TF

2349
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:24,719
should always be ahead. Probably

2350
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:26,320
shouldn't be two kills worth of gold uh

2351
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,520
7 minutes in. That is a little bit

2352
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,480
ridiculous.

2353
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:31,360
Yeah.

2354
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:33,440
Um he's just uh having a good time.

2355
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,400
Does have his

2356
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:36,800
Yeah, I don't I don't think you're

2357
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:39,520
killing here. the amount of times we saw

2358
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:41,199
Keenh. Okay, he's gone all out though as

2359
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,920
now the destiny coming towards the top

2360
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:46,159
side and yeah, the Sichuani was here but

2361
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:49,440
she can't save him from that. That is

2362
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:52,400
first blood going over to the Casante

2363
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:54,320
and now life is way better. Yeah, Canyon

2364
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,760
in position towards his bottom side.

2365
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,639
They do have vision. They know exactly

2366
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,639
where he is.

2367
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,719
Well, there's cleanse and heal as well.

2368
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:02,719
Yeah,

2369
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,000
see whether the Grim can keep alive now.

2370
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,199
Faker's roaming as They're like, "No,

2371
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,679
no, no, no, no, no, no."

2372
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:10,000
Yeah, not worth it. Uh, Trophy has a rod

2373
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:12,080
of ages at 7 minutes, 8 minutes.

2374
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,880
That's not

2375
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,719
Um, so he'll have that one stacked up.

2376
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,560
It's going to be low value though, guys.

2377
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:20,320
Uh, because of course the later levels,

2378
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,840
the more valuable ones to get and he'll

2379
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,280
have it fully stacked before he gets to

2380
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:26,280
those later levels. That was first

2381
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,280
blood.

2382
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,400
You're you're a glass half full kind of

2383
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,159
guy. Kind of love it

2384
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,719
for T1. That was a glass half full for

2385
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:36,560
T1. And that was sarcasm because Genji

2386
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,480
are pretty happy with the fact that he

2387
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:40,560
picks up a full item.

2388
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,920
The one the one big lead that they had

2389
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,360
was towards the top side of the map. And

2390
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:44,400
that kill on key

2391
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,400
is a big deal.

2392
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,600
You know how you were saying it's two uh

2393
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,119
kills worth of gold.

2394
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,600
Yeah. It's it's almost free.

2395
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,360
Yeah.

2396
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:53,280
Yeah.

2397
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:55,600
So that's the thing we don't really need

2398
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:57,920
to we'll we'll we'll circle back and

2399
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,880
we'll have a bit more of a chat about

2400
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,320
further down the line.

2401
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,920
It's always what what do you actually

2402
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,159
get out of the lead, right? like

2403
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,800
yeah,

2404
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:06,159
but as you highlight starting to stack

2405
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,159
your rowa early I think is really

2406
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:10,239
valuable.

2407
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:11,840
Just having a full item in general

2408
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:15,840
compared to Faker who's only sitting on

2409
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:18,400
components is a big deal. The grubs were

2410
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:21,440
spread two to one. So one for Genji, two

2411
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:22,960
for T1. Yep. And also like for Twisted

2412
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,560
Fate, you just kind of want to get to

2413
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:26,480
your rapid fire cannon and your lich

2414
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,480
banes and things like this as quickly as

2415
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:31,199
possible. I feel like his build adds so

2416
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:33,520
much utility to his kit along the way.

2417
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:34,639
And so the acceleration in gold really

2418
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,920
going to be very helpful there.

2419
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,520
Something we've been talking about for

2420
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:40,080
millennia is what it kind of feels like.

2421
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,840
If he's been virtually unchanged, right,

2422
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,840
for the longest time.

2423
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:47,119
We do have Canyon just continuously

2424
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:49,360
trying, but maybe gets a maybe it's old.

2425
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:51,760
There's the Impale almost catches in max

2426
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:54,080
range, but Faker a little bit faster

2427
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,760
than Canyon was expecting.

2428
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,679
Faker still at his old as well, so I

2429
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,639
think Canyon knew like if he flashes

2430
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:00,960
doesn't really do anything. He just

2431
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:05,440
wastes his flash. not going to do that.

2432
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:07,119
And we do need to reiterate T1's comp

2433
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:09,040
scales

2434
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:09,600
monstrously well. The only particularly

2435
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,719
into team fight.

2436
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,239
Yeah, the the only part that doesn't

2437
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,400
scale super well is obviously with Jace

2438
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:15,679
and like I think even in Jace's case,

2439
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,119
Jace to me is just one of those

2440
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:20,239
champions now that just kind of always

2441
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:21,840
is good. Like I I

2442
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:24,159
going to get exhausted here as he does

2443
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,400
cleanse it. Carrier looks for the charm,

2444
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:28,239
but he gets the flash instead. And

2445
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,679
honestly, I think T1 are going to be

2446
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:32,080
pretty happy about that. But that is two

2447
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:33,920
summoner spells for the price of none.

2448
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,840
Yeah, big mistake there from Ruler cuz

2449
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:38,480
Duro wasn't around. So he had to play a

2450
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:40,639
little bit more safe. Did not do so. We

2451
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:43,679
do have Canyon maybe looking for a play

2452
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:45,760
towards bot side. Goomba has his old but

2453
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:46,639
I think there really is too big of an

2454
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,760
angle here.

2455
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:49,600
Yeah, there's a little bit of a knock up

2456
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,040
on Canyon, but he's immune to damage is

2457
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,600
what it looks like. He's got two belts,

2458
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:55,119
so his pants are well and truly held up.

2459
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,639
Maybe he's like one is the pen and then

2460
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:58,320
the other is like over the chest like

2461
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:58,719
one of the cool belts. I mean like a

2462
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,159
technical

2463
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:02,320
with this skin. You don't even have

2464
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:04,239
legs. So I don't know what the pants are

2465
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,480
doing. But he does have two belts for

2466
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:06,320
them.

2467
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,760
So it's double cross, you know, like

2468
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,320
across the chest. And he just has like a

2469
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,239
bunch of

2470
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,840
Oh no, he's got two belts because you

2471
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:14,080
need two belts around the caterpillar

2472
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:17,440
track things that he's got.

2473
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:19,040
Oh, different kind of belt. Oh, yep.

2474
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,000
It's I was just thinking about the wrong

2475
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:22,159
belt.

2476
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,679
I I I'm sorry I didn't back you up.

2477
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:25,920
Actually, he can have two more belts cuz

2478
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:27,760
he also has the things on his arms. All

2479
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,920
right. So, we need to build more belts.

2480
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:32,560
Um, Canyon needs to make sure that he

2481
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,400
gets a gets a gets a Warmog on the way.

2482
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,320
I also Yeah. Well, I also have seen a

2483
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,000
good amount of Twitter discourse about

2484
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,840
like actually the optimal You might not

2485
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
like it, but peak tank performance is

2486
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,679
just building giant belts.

2487
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,360
Well, then it it also makes sense

2488
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:46,080
because he needs so many belts cuz he's

2489
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,679
a machine.

2490
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:50,560
Yep.

2491
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:52,800
It's glorious. Well, Destiny is um not

2492
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,480
exactly kind to Doran here towards the

2493
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,920
top side of the map as going all out.

2494
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:57,600
Not sure if he's going all in and Doran

2495
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,960
is real dead. That is a kill going over

2496
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,080
to the Twisted Fate. Um, and we we're

2497
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,000
talking about a kill worth of gold.

2498
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,360
Well, he has that now as Flash is going

2499
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,639
to be invested here by Duro to get

2500
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,719
himself out of the way of the Emperor's

2501
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:10,960
Divide, but he's still moving forward.

2502
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:12,320
Ruler lit on fire here as Ona comes on

2503
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,199
over with a summoner spell that he

2504
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,600
didn't have at the beginning of the

2505
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:16,960
game.

2506
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:20,000
Love that. Owner with the aura ignite.

2507
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:21,520
You love to see it as Troas now parked

2508
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,639
himself on the top side of the map and

2509
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,080
he's going to look to take that one

2510
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:26,560
down. And that should give T1 a bit of

2511
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,000
an angle towards this dragon. Bit of a

2512
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:29,440
check-in when it comes to feats of

2513
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,199
strength and how we're doing there. If

2514
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,840
T1 do manage to take down this dragon,

2515
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:35,760
then they'll only need another objective

2516
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:38,239
to be able to lock down that portion as

2517
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,760
Genji one kill away from the feats of

2518
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:41,520
warfare.

2519
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,880
And Chobi is getting to work on this

2520
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,239
turret to the point where we might need

2521
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,600
to be talking about first turret blood

2522
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,960
as well. I don't know whether he's going

2523
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,440
to take it on this push cuz that is

2524
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:51,440
going to be a Keech dragon. King finding

2525
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:53,760
a little queue and is going to be eating

2526
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,320
a bunch of CC and feeling happy about it

2527
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,760
as

2528
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,080
not again. Not again. Not again. Not

2529
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,600
again.

2530
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,760
He just got back.

2531
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,880
He doesn't want the dying spree. Not a

2532
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,239
dying spree as that's a bit of a

2533
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:06,000
driveby. Doesn't quite work here for

2534
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:07,600
Canyon as Chovi does find a blue card.

2535
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,520
Sure about that one as Doran's going to

2536
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:13,119
be able to take down the scanner. And

2537
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:14,880
it's a disaster here for Geng as T1 even

2538
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:18,639
out the kills and well and truly strike

2539
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:20,159
back. carry up the hero that Doran

2540
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,239
needed.

2541
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:24,880
Making sure that his top laner stays

2542
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:26,960
alive after these continued dives. And

2543
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,199
now all of a sudden T1 is winning on

2544
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,360
multiple sides of the map. They're able

2545
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:32,480
to push in and bot fully keen off the

2546
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,760
turret as Chovi.

2547
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,040
Yeah, this is a big deal if they can

2548
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,239
lock down this kill. And they got three

2549
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,760
people here. He wants to deal with the

2550
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,440
minions that are in position as he

2551
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,639
flashes away from his turret. And that

2552
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,080
is going to mean that he's dead. Cute

2553
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:43,280
little gold card towards the end there,

2554
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,639
but not going to be able to get too

2555
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:47,119
much. He still has a massive gold lead,

2556
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:48,400
but he's now not on the map. And Genji

2557
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:50,239
kind of falling apart at the scenes. We

2558
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,639
were talking about the feats of warfare

2559
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:54,560
that Genji was so close to getting. T1

2560
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,639
just claimed it. And now they just need

2561
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,159
to get another dragon, a herald,

2562
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:00,719
something like that, they'll be sitting

2563
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:02,800
pretty bit sloppy there for Genji cuz

2564
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,800
they could have called this off. I think

2565
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,199
the moment they spot that Raan.

2566
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,679
Yeah. But instead, if Kenyan just

2567
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:11,600
flashes out instead of trying to prime

2568
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,760
with the ultimate, I think they just get

2569
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:15,840
out instead and they're fine. But they

2570
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,760
try to actually make it work. Timely

2571
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,239
arrival from Guma to catch there as

2572
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,440
well. And then I like that T1 also, they

2573
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:23,600
know where everyone is on the map,

2574
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,920
right? They know that Duro and Keen are

2575
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:28,480
bot. They just killed Scarnner as well

2576
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:31,920
as the Lucian. So they can just dive

2577
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:33,920
Chobi there and T1 on an even game

2578
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,000
state. I'll take them anytime. Every

2579
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:40,480
time. The amount of damage this team has

2580
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:42,000
is incredible. And I I we have seen

2581
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,600
Genji play this exact composition in

2582
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,119
late game. And I think it can be done.

2583
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:47,199
It's very poke heavy, right? You just

2584
01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:49,199
gold card, do some poke, back off.

2585
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:50,800
Yeah. And you can play it in a 1 131

2586
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:51,119
things like that. More of a full one. I

2587
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,520
guess

2588
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:55,440
there are ways, but by default, if

2589
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,360
you're T1 and you get to two items, you

2590
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:59,040
get to free items, you're going to be

2591
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:01,440
feeling amazing. You're going to have

2592
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:03,520
intense amounts of damage. You're going

2593
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:05,840
to have, I think, as long as you

2594
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,280
actually stick together, not a lot of

2595
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,560
weak spots, not a lot of people that are

2596
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:10,480
easily targeted, right? There's a lot of

2597
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:13,520
mobility, there's a lot of beefiness.

2598
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:15,440
Really, only Doran can be found. And

2599
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:17,119
between Owner and Carrie, I don't think

2600
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:18,960
they're going to let his their body go

2601
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:20,639
down that easily.

2602
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,560
Just have to see whether Genji can find

2603
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,880
some of that magic or whether this is

2604
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,800
indeed going to be that threeame series

2605
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,639
that I think we all want.

2606
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:32,560
Would like that, especially most of

2607
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:34,719
Inchan. um as they are all there in the

2608
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:37,199
stadium.

2609
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:38,239
Let's just see as Gumushi taking a lot

2610
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:39,599
of damage there. And in fact, the

2611
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,719
culling comes on out here from Ruler.

2612
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:42,480
Owner going to be blocking that one, but

2613
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,480
Gumushi is out of this fight now. Does

2614
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,159
have to eat the honey fruit. Chia's old.

2615
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:48,880
Got to be a little careful.

2616
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:50,639
Yeah. Uh probably doesn't want to use it

2617
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:52,800
because I think Chovi prefer just to be

2618
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:55,280
parked in lane. Does actually throw out

2619
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,040
the destiny. Hasn't gated around just

2620
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:58,639
yet as the gold card does come on

2621
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,560
through. But that is a big cool down

2622
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:03,440
that they now take as he makes his way

2623
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,199
back towards the rest of his team. Yushi

2624
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:07,520
does have half of his health bar back up

2625
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:09,840
once again, but Canyon has position now

2626
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,360
on this Rift Herald. It looks like Geng

2627
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,880
might be the ones to claim that one as

2628
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:14,639
Ruler parked in mid is going to put on

2629
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:17,520
that extra pressure. Are they actually

2630
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:19,599
going to get it off that? That's crazy.

2631
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:21,280
Kind of ridiculous.

2632
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:22,960
Uh I think T1 is still going to look for

2633
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,679
the contest. And look, Faker making his

2634
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,040
way over.

2635
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:26,400
Yeah, let's see whether the pigeon can

2636
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,239
find the angle as the glacial prison

2637
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:30,880
doesn't quite get there as now Chovy

2638
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:32,159
gets the gold card onto Faker. And now

2639
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,599
for the rest of the fight, Canyon going

2640
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:36,000
down. extraordinarily low. There's the

2641
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:37,520
jungler out of it. Emperor's Divide not

2642
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,440
really finding it, but it pushes them

2643
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,599
out of the pit as Keane. He's gone all

2644
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:43,280
out, but he is in fact all out. Double

2645
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:44,639
knock up there from Carrier as well.

2646
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:47,119
Looking fantastic. Rule the front

2647
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,719
lining. Doesn't want to as he flashes to

2648
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:50,719
get out of the way. And that is Faker on

2649
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:52,719
the board with a kill on Duro that he

2650
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:54,159
was looking for before. And Choby not

2651
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:55,599
going to get hit by that grand entrance,

2652
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:57,920
but I still think he's in a bit of

2653
01:52:55,599 --> 01:53:00,159
trouble here as Ruler wanting to try and

2654
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:02,159
catch them off guard as another gold

2655
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:04,880
card is locked in. Wild cards actually

2656
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:06,880
hitting all of them there as somehow

2657
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:09,520
it's Faker that managed to just take

2658
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:11,119
down Ruler. Chroy will survive and T1

2659
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:14,400
limp away.

2660
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:18,880
But T1 going to be happy with that one.

2661
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:21,920
Herold found fight one. Mid lane turret

2662
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:23,760
sieged. Possible setup towards Drake as

2663
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:27,840
well. Now the gold blade firmly in their

2664
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:30,639
favor and a 402 Z as well. Quick blades

2665
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:33,599
now completed. Kumishi, he's pretty

2666
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:35,119
ridiculously good on this champion. And

2667
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:36,560
let's have a look at it once again as

2668
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:38,080
this was an awkward fight. You know, it

2669
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,480
was on all sorts of different fronts,

2670
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:42,800
but T1 play it masterfully.

2671
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:44,960
The big thing for me is that Faker zones

2672
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:47,520
out together with Goomba at the start.

2673
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:50,639
Three of the members of Geng. And like

2674
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:53,040
despite some true keen Sante heroics, he

2675
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:55,040
can't actually 1v9, right? That's not a

2676
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,119
thing that you can do. So, he does get

2677
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:58,880
taken down eventually by GMA, by Doran.

2678
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:01,520
So the setup of the fight is really nice

2679
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:04,400
for T1 and if Genji can't actually blow

2680
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:06,080
up a member individually or poke away.

2681
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:08,400
We do see that comp struggle a little

2682
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:09,920
bit as Ruler and Chovi try to clutch

2683
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:13,199
this fight out. But the flash forward

2684
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:14,960
from Guma not afraid finds the kill.

2685
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:18,159
That's now another drake going over to

2686
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:19,119
T1 and I think thus far we are looking

2687
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,719
good

2688
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:22,239
although Dor might be caught.

2689
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:23,920
This is a really awkward position here

2690
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:25,599
as Canyon walks over the ward. They get

2691
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,000
the information here with the destiny as

2692
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:30,880
there is the glacial fissure and oh the

2693
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:33,679
emperor's divide by faker is glorious as

2694
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:35,360
they lock down chovi. They'll also take

2695
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:36,639
the scanner as well as kumushi in a

2696
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,560
little bit of trouble here as Keen

2697
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:41,599
manages to get one back but it's only on

2698
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:43,679
to Doran and T1 are now chasing down the

2699
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:47,199
remaining stragglers of Genji and they

2700
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:48,880
do it so so well with this composition.

2701
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:50,320
There is the culling. It doesn't really

2702
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,159
do too much of anything at all as the

2703
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:53,520
perafrost not going to connect onto Duro

2704
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:55,760
there, but he has to flash to get out of

2705
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:58,560
the way and they'll trade Doran for a

2706
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:03,440
whole bunch more here as T1 move to 10

2707
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:04,719
and four and JG is tenacious but T1 he's

2708
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:07,840
getting the better end of them anyway.

2709
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:09,520
Faker having big impact on this Azir

2710
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:11,119
consistently finding the plays and

2711
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,239
despite the gold lead which by the way

2712
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:14,800
is dwindling.

2713
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:17,360
Yeah and that gold lead for Chroy is now

2714
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,639
down to 700. That's more than haveved.

2715
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:20,159
It's kind of ridiculous.

2716
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:21,199
It is the dwindling gold lead.

2717
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:22,560
Oh, that's the gold lead.

2718
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:25,199
Well, there was a lot of dwindling gold

2719
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,119
leads to Atlas. Um, as we as we

2720
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:28,560
highlighted, it's very nicely done here.

2721
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:30,719
There's no flash for Chobi, so he just

2722
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,159
ends up dying there. Canyon, even if he

2723
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:33,679
hits more people, I don't think it

2724
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:35,920
really does anything. Cute there that he

2725
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:38,159
gets the wall slam on the Doran.

2726
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,320
That is funny. And then here there's the

2727
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:42,480
attempt, but I actually think this old

2728
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:44,159
from Keen doesn't quite hit the mark. I

2729
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:46,719
think he probably was looking to drag

2730
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:47,679
him over the wall like into the pit and

2731
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:49,280
play from there.

2732
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,840
Gets his feather storm off cool down

2733
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,280
right there,

2734
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,520
right at the wrong time. And but also

2735
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,880
the fact that he basically drags Desire

2736
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,040
towards his team, right?

2737
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,880
Uh not what he was looking for. Also

2738
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:00,960
good there from Guma. I think that might

2739
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:03,199
have been just allowing uh what allowed

2740
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,760
him to reposition in a way that

2741
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:08,560
made that play work. And I think right

2742
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:11,360
now things are looking really good for a

2743
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,800
game number three Atlas T1. The only

2744
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:14,400
thing they need to ensure is don't throw

2745
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,760
out a card. I think that that's that's

2746
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,159
really it. You have an incredibly

2747
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:20,000
scaling composition. Be careful about

2748
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:22,480
the side lanes. Genji do still have a

2749
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,280
lot of burst on single members. If they

2750
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:27,520
can zone someone off, beacon sees what

2751
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:30,719
T1. They're death balling and I think

2752
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,960
they should. Yeah, it's working. Carrier

2753
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,440
does move into this tri brush. They get

2754
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:37,679
control vision in the area. The other is

2755
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:39,760
just gone. Just going down and Genji no

2756
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:42,000
real right to head over there. Vision is

2757
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:43,440
paramount and they have none of it and

2758
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,080
so Genji just going to settle with an

2759
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:47,080
outer turret in mid.

2760
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:53,679
Kuman carry out the Zion Raan.

2761
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,320
The team fighting of D2 has been

2762
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:56,159
incredible.

2763
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:58,960
Look for this as Ona comes on over. They

2764
01:56:56,159 --> 01:57:01,199
clear out the wave. Concussive blows and

2765
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:03,920
nothing really happens here as that was

2766
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:05,520
a cleanse of the air from Chovi.

2767
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:07,599
Come on, bro. You got to trust Duro.

2768
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:09,199
Trust your buddy. Dura would never would

2769
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:11,119
never let that hit you.

2770
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:14,159
I mean, the hit box of the glacial

2771
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:16,080
prison is a bit funky. Maybe that was

2772
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:18,159
atlas. It's about trust. If you ever

2773
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,480
tell me to catch that skill shot for

2774
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:19,199
you,

2775
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,800
Yeah, exactly.

2776
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:22,159
I would I would trust you blind, I

2777
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,639
probably die because of it, but it'd be

2778
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:26,760
worth it.

2779
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,760
And I tell you, you should have claimed.

2780
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:31,920
Anyway, T1 going to be able to secure

2781
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:34,080
their blue buff and now look to put more

2782
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:36,080
pressure on the map. And it's so hard

2783
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,280
now as Genji's composition to play the

2784
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,719
game because look at Chovy. He is

2785
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:40,239
running away from the minion wave. Uh

2786
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:42,000
that is precisely not what you want to

2787
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:44,000
be doing as the Twisted Fate. You want

2788
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,159
to continue that pressure as much as

2789
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,080
possible. And if you do have control of

2790
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:50,320
the map, then you can utilize it. In

2791
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:51,840
this case, he absolutely cannot.

2792
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:54,000
It's just rough. Now you're getting

2793
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:55,520
perma slowed by the Azir. There are

2794
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,960
three targets you need to deal with cuz

2795
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:58,960
all of them have enough damage to carry

2796
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:01,440
a team fight. There is great front line,

2797
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:02,719
great engage. this T1 composition. I

2798
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,599
think we saw in the early game what

2799
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:07,199
could go wrong. Some of the picks kind

2800
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,719
of highlighted how Genji would like to

2801
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:11,199
play, but here I think we're going to

2802
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:13,280
need to see both a crazy Jenji team

2803
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:14,960
fight and I think it comes down to does

2804
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:17,760
Gmba live? If Gmba gets taken out

2805
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:19,840
somehow by the Keen Sante or Chi finds a

2806
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,719
crazy flank, maybe that can be

2807
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,159
something, but realistically T1 should

2808
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:26,320
be able to get themselves the sole point

2809
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:28,880
here. And is the soul the biggest deal?

2810
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:31,440
Not really. But for Genji's comp, trying

2811
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:34,080
to actually chew for some of extra uh

2812
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:35,840
damage resistance is still nice. There's

2813
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:37,440
that RFC, but I don't know if it's going

2814
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,840
to be enough. Trying to get himself out

2815
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,760
of here. Does manage to dash away. Holds

2816
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:44,800
onto the flash for the moment. 50% of

2817
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:46,400
his health is now missing.

2818
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,040
It's a tough one as T1 just continue

2819
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:50,560
this relentless pressure. Joby has found

2820
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:52,080
a lane, but look at this. The poke on

2821
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:53,520
Ruler is just kind of gigantic and the

2822
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:55,119
rest of T1 just continuing to push

2823
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,480
forward. They'll take down this inner

2824
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:58,719
turret very comfortably with four

2825
01:58:56,480 --> 01:59:01,280
members and Canyon just not quite here

2826
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:03,760
in time to try and alleviate anything as

2827
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:05,920
Keen comes on over and is trying to

2828
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,440
defend against Faker's push but it is

2829
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,119
unrelenting. Does take a lot of damage

2830
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:10,960
here from the Keen Sante as the Empress

2831
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:12,800
Divide is going to have to be employed.

2832
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,920
That means that T1 do not have that if

2833
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,840
there is going to be a bit of a team

2834
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,599
fight. The glacial prison also was

2835
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,040
thrown out earlier on as carrier looks

2836
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:21,280
for a bit of an angle here. Gets the

2837
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:22,960
charm onto Chovi.

2838
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:25,679
So T1 not really hard committing as it's

2839
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:28,000
a fight for a Gromp guys. Um there's the

2840
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:30,239
destiny and okay Toby thinks that this

2841
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,599
is maybe an angle. Shifting sands does

2842
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:34,159
get Faker out of there and remember this

2843
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:35,679
is three items onto Choby now. Maybe

2844
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:37,440
it's an opportunity but you can see the

2845
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:40,560
culling just kind of hitting the air and

2846
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:42,159
now T1 they can back away if they'd like

2847
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:44,400
to. Would they like a team fight? That

2848
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:46,320
is our question. But without the Empress

2849
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:49,040
Divide perhaps they do not want it.

2850
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:50,960
Well Cheni is slow playing this. do have

2851
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:52,639
Doran probably looking for a base and

2852
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:54,560
immediately TPing back. There's a good

2853
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,920
amount of flank angles behind them.

2854
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:58,239
Yeah, there is a mega cone here as well

2855
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:01,119
for Troy if you'd like to utilize it.

2856
01:59:58,239 --> 02:00:03,599
Oh, Doran. Yeah, there is the teleport

2857
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:05,360
in as Doran diving on top of Kane here

2858
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:08,000
as Joby holding on to this gold card for

2859
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:09,599
such a long time. Carrier comes on over

2860
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,599
and there is the all out. It is going to

2861
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:13,280
be the secure on the dragon with that

2862
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:14,800
unsealed spell book from Duro as

2863
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:17,920
Canyon's just going to drive his way out

2864
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:19,760
as best he can. Down goes Doran as Geni,

2865
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,119
they slow down Carrier as well. And I

2866
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:23,520
don't think he's long for this world as

2867
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:25,040
the Ardan Blaze will be able to tag him.

2868
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:27,520
So, he's not going to be executing

2869
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:29,599
himself just yet. And so, Genji able to

2870
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:31,520
deny the soul and will also find

2871
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:34,239
themselves I could you call it a fight?

2872
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:37,679
I guess you could call it a fight.

2873
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:39,199
I'm kind of in awe that that worked. I I

2874
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:40,239
guess it's the power of No Emperor's

2875
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,360
Divide for a while.

2876
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:43,840
So, there's a lot of layers to it.

2877
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:46,000
There's the Oh, Trophy might be dead. So

2878
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:48,639
there's the power of no emperor thereby.

2879
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,159
There is also T1. We keep talking about

2880
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:51,840
hook at their fighters that isn't a

2881
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:54,320
frontto back scenario where you have

2882
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:57,440
owner and carrier standing for this is a

2883
02:00:54,320 --> 02:01:00,320
skirmish like this is a broken up messy

2884
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:02,960
fight and GNG are simultaneously forcing

2885
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:04,400
T1 to respond to dragon cuz if T1 fully

2886
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:06,800
commit to either side I think they have

2887
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:09,440
a large angle to win the fight even

2888
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:11,440
without the ultimate but instead Chovi

2889
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:13,119
and Keen are two between Dor and a car

2890
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:15,840
they're going to win that right like

2891
02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:17,920
between the TF and the Keen Sante that's

2892
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:19,520
no biggie and then on the other

2893
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,560
If it was any other Casante, that would

2894
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:22,719
have been a very difficult fight.

2895
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:23,599
Oh, I I I I think that that might have

2896
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,360
been rough. But

2897
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:27,040
maybe not Dundon.

2898
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,920
Don't remind me, bro. I I don't want to.

2899
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:30,560
That's like a whole another

2900
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:32,320
conversation. I I I I don't I He's in

2901
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,639
the LC now. You know, he's it which is

2902
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,840
nice.

2903
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:36,480
He's riding, you know.

2904
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:38,159
Well, I uh don't Let's not Let's not

2905
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:40,800
talk about all reliable, okay? It's too

2906
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:43,360
much. But he did teach us that Grump is

2907
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:45,679
important as Geng startup Nash.

2908
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:49,119
Yeah. This is what they learned from T1.

2909
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:52,239
And the just start up the baron if you

2910
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:53,679
finding an angle or did T1 find a Chobi?

2911
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:55,119
Chobi kind of knew that this was what

2912
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:56,880
was happening. He doesn't have an arm

2913
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:58,719
guard so he's just dead. And now the

2914
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:01,679
quickness goes all over the rest of

2915
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:04,159
Geng. Can they find it? No, they cannot.

2916
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:06,719
The Emperor's Divide throws them into

2917
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:08,239
the mix. And now Ona trying to dash his

2918
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:10,800
way out. Ruler is doing a decent job,

2919
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:13,040
but Gumushi just getting on in there. My

2920
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,679
god, he slaughterers them. It's a triple

2921
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:18,400
kill for the Z. and T1 say well I guess

2922
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:20,719
we'll take a Baron.

2923
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:23,199
Uh maybe if you have flash and ZAS

2924
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:25,119
Chovy. Oh Kane's going to die isn't he?

2925
02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:25,920
Ah I've seen these before. Jonah strong.

2926
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:30,000
I know what's coming.

2927
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:31,599
Hey no but he got he got the raptor.

2928
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,599
Actually I don't even like Doran doesn't

2929
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:35,760
have a whole lot of health. Um so

2930
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:36,800
if it was just Doran and he didn't know

2931
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:38,560
that it was just Doran.

2932
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:41,599
He has a he has a lot of whis it would

2933
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:44,880
have been fine. Uh

2934
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:46,159
my only read is like I I actually I

2935
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,199
don't know like cuz you know where

2936
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:49,760
everyone is.

2937
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:51,599
Yeah. It's not even like ET not you know

2938
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:53,440
where everyone is. Chobi just goes too

2939
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,599
deep. The response from and this is the

2940
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:59,280
front to back. Look at this. We have

2941
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:01,920
Guma and Faker doing damage. On the

2942
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:04,320
front and a beautiful from him and then

2943
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:05,760
Ruler actually does take down Kara is

2944
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:08,159
trying to make and then Guma just

2945
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:09,360
flashes in. uh does a really good job.

2946
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:11,040
Gets all the damage out.

2947
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:13,040
I think Faker's disappointed that uh

2948
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:14,800
Choby died so early because it was a

2949
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,400
fiveman shock wave in game one, but

2950
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:17,920
there were only four alive to hit with

2951
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,560
the Emperor's Divide in game two.

2952
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,119
Y

2953
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:24,080
Oh, it's completely unfair. Um it would

2954
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:25,280
have been five five if Chovi hadn't have

2955
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:28,639
just sort of

2956
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:30,159
gated his way into death. Okay,

2957
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,560
so we'll give them an even on that

2958
02:03:30,159 --> 02:03:32,080
front.

2959
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,760
It's just it's classic Chobi, you know,

2960
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:36,239
he's just calibrating how to make more

2961
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,599
plays. That was that one is going in the

2962
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:38,719
data set is not it.

2963
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:40,320
Yeah, it was not quite it.

2964
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:41,679
That was that was not I I do think it

2965
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:43,119
was already a Hillary, right? Starting

2966
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:44,480
the Baron in the first place trying to

2967
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:46,000
look for that turn, but

2968
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:46,480
he can make the play now. He's got his

2969
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,280
arm guard.

2970
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:50,639
Well, the game is done now. So I I I I

2971
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:52,639
think the game was already in a rough

2972
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:54,480
spot. That play was, don't get me wrong,

2973
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:56,000
that play was bad. I think that the fact

2974
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,280
that they started up Nash kind of shows

2975
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,560
that Jen also knows that they're a

2976
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:01,119
little cooked.

2977
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:03,280
Are getting that sick cleanse. Yeah,

2978
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:05,199
this game is looking mighty over and I

2979
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:06,080
love that Atlas. That's That's good cuz

2980
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:08,000
that means

2981
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:10,480
the series ain't over

2982
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,760
which which I love that we have gotten

2983
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:15,440
max games for Geng1 in what the last

2984
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,760
How many has it been cuz it was the two

2985
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:17,440
and

2986
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:20,159
so was both out of MSI they didn't face

2987
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:22,400
and ros MSI round I think round robin

2988
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:23,920
two was a two I think round robin one

2989
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,199
was incredible but round robin two I

2990
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:27,119
remember being a bit of a let down

2991
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:28,320
yeah it wasn't it wasn't super hard not

2992
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:30,320
this one Atlas

2993
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:32,800
not this time around as we move into our

2994
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:34,639
first ever round three as we get a zoom

2995
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,800
in on the gold card being collected by

2996
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:38,159
the bird that was flapping away. So,

2997
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:40,480
that's not going to eventuate in

2998
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:42,480
anything at all. Bounties now up and

2999
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:43,599
available here if Genji can ever get out

3000
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,960
of their base. But, I just don't know

3001
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:47,599
whether that's ever happening. 20

3002
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:48,960
seconds on this dragon would be soul

3003
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,639
point for either team.

3004
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,159
So, they don't have to play for the next

3005
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,560
RA cuz they got the last one, which is

3006
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:55,760
nice thanks to Duro Smite. But

3007
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:57,040
maybe they will anyway.

3008
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:58,960
Well, I don't I hope they don't cuz

3009
02:04:57,040 --> 02:05:02,000
they're also playing. But to what end is

3010
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:02,639
what I ask you, Atlas? because the dead

3011
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,239
nexus

3012
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:05,840
well do you really want this game to go

3013
02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:08,080
like what are you playing for there's

3014
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,560
not normally in these type of situations

3015
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:09,840
they're like

3016
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:12,159
I mean that's a that's a much deeper

3017
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:14,639
question than you may think because

3018
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:17,520
team's already qualified for worlds so

3019
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:19,679
what are they playing for chronic

3020
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:21,199
to keep the streak alive

3021
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,239
yeah but I they they've been in

3022
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:23,520
interviews and they're like yeah we

3023
02:05:22,239 --> 02:05:24,400
don't really care we just want to play

3024
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:25,679
well

3025
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:27,520
which I I tend to believe

3026
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:29,440
I mean these are competitors if they had

3027
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:31,119
the mindset of I guess we take a holiday

3028
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:32,560
now then they wouldn't be the player.

3029
02:05:31,119 --> 02:05:33,520
They wouldn't be they wouldn't be on the

3030
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:35,280
streak. Yeah.

3031
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:37,040
Um there's also that statement is then

3032
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:40,560
always followed followed up by we just

3033
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:41,679
want to do well at worlds which

3034
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,639
that's everyone.

3035
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:44,000
Yep.

3036
02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:45,760
That's that's how it goes.

3037
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,360
It is something that they haven't quite

3038
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:49,520
managed to achieve just yet.

3039
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:51,360
Need a heal marry here. Maybe a

3040
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:52,400
multi-man from Canyon. Otherwise, we go

3041
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,760
in the game free.

3042
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:56,080
Oh, there's the destiny to come in there

3043
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:58,000
as they found Canyon on the flank. He

3044
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:59,520
only gets Ona with the ulti as now

3045
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,560
Gumishi is in a little bit of trouble,

3046
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:02,239
but he's got the feather storm. He's

3047
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:03,520
buying so much time and the Emperor's

3048
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:05,440
Divide to get him out of there as well.

3049
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:08,000
Ruler is the one that's down so low as

3050
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:10,239
they trade 80 carries as now Keane dives

3051
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,800
in, but he cannot pick anyone up. And

3052
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:14,480
it's Doran finding his revenge. He'll

3053
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:16,719
also get cleansed. Everything is fine.

3054
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:18,719
And now Chrovy and Duro versus the world

3055
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:21,280
as the teleport to get Chroy out of

3056
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:23,440
there will be interrupted by Ona as

3057
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:24,880
Doran says, "Yeah, we are going to a

3058
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:28,159
game three." And I'm going to take us

3059
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:30,000
there by destroying these nexus turrets.

3060
02:06:28,159 --> 02:06:31,599
And he's getting some revenge after

3061
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,520
being bullied earlier on. These health

3062
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:35,440
bars aren't going down as fast as they

3063
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,040
really wanted to as Chobby flashes out

3064
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:39,360
of the Grand Entrance. And we're just

3065
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:41,520
going to zoom in here on Doran booping

3066
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:43,280
down this nexus with his hammer. gets

3067
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:45,280
the gun out there as well just to show

3068
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:47,199
that it can transform. That was real

3069
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:49,360
cute. There's a demonstration of that 50

3070
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:51,280
gold that I was talking about. That is

3071
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,850
very, very important to bring us to game

3072
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:54,320
three.

3073
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:59,520
[Music]

3074
02:06:54,320 --> 02:07:02,639
T1 team fighting will bring us to a game

3075
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,000
number three, a Genji composition that

3076
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:06,239
had us going, I don't know about that,

3077
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,000
but it's Geng. and then turned out

3078
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:10,719
they have made comps like that work in

3079
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:14,079
the past but against everything they

3080
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:16,239
gave to T1 that's the real problem and

3081
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:19,040
this is a conversation that uh was had

3082
02:07:16,239 --> 02:07:20,639
on the desk yesterday as well sometimes

3083
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,440
you look at your composition you're like

3084
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:23,040
yeah

3085
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,239
I love that composition

3086
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:26,320
and then you look over to the other one

3087
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:28,960
you're like ah that one's better

3088
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:30,400
that one was better and uh in this case

3089
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:31,920
I think the execution from team one was

3090
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:33,840
also great they did have to navigate the

3091
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:36,079
early again we saw a slight lead uh

3092
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:38,400
eventuate there, but particularly

3093
02:07:36,079 --> 02:07:40,719
carryon, right? I think his turning

3094
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:43,440
blade towards the top side ended up

3095
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:45,199
being really big for Genji uh or for

3096
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:47,280
rather for T1 to turn this area around

3097
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:48,639
and for Genji to kind of stop losing

3098
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:50,800
that or start losing that momentum

3099
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:53,360
because you can see I think that dive is

3100
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,560
right where that little gold lead

3101
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:56,719
evaporates

3102
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:59,440
and then you had the big team fight and

3103
02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:01,040
then the game really became a struggle

3104
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:02,800
from that point on. We won't talk about

3105
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:04,320
that weird dragon scenario and all that

3106
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,719
sort of stuff that happened afterwards.

3107
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,679
It was fun.

3108
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:06,719
It was a bit of a blip,

3109
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:09,199
but it was distraction.

3110
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:11,840
It was and it didn't really mean too

3111
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:13,360
much. So T1, they will even it out. We

3112
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:14,800
will go to three. Time for us to take a

3113
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,560
short break. When we get back, the space

3114
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:18,639
going to break that one down. Then we'll

3115
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:21,520
have the deciding game between T1 and

3116
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:23,920
Geng. Will it be T1 that breaks the

3117
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:27,159
streak at the T1 home ground? Find out

3118
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:27,159
after this.

Hello and welcome back to the space. I

3165
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:03,599
can say proudly that we do have a series

3166
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:06,400
on our hands now as T1 was able to take

3167
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:08,000
game number two away from Gen G. Gen

3168
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:09,920
with a pretty interesting draft. Didn't

3169
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
quite work out for them after that top

3170
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,199
dive and T1 was able to take the game

3171
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,320
from there. are pretty interesting

3172
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:14,800
stuff. Guys, what do you think about

3173
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,079
that game?

3174
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:18,960
I really want to talk about the draft

3175
02:15:16,079 --> 02:15:21,119
because while Geng are an incredibly

3176
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:23,679
strong team and they can make almost

3177
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:26,159
anything work, uh they had a very

3178
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:28,480
similar draft to this at the EWC finals

3179
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:30,880
in game five, right? But I think they

3180
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:33,520
may have forgotten that they got a duo

3181
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,880
kill on Hope and Kyle early in that game

3182
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:37,040
and Ruler was super accelerated because

3183
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,639
in order to win this game, you need your

3184
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:40,639
Lucian to be ahead. You need to have map

3185
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:43,119
control the entire time because you just

3186
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:45,199
otherwise don't have damage. Sure, TF

3187
02:15:43,119 --> 02:15:46,960
can gold card somebody, but if you can't

3188
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:48,880
kill them, it doesn't really matter. And

3189
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:49,920
I think T1's comp was just way stronger

3190
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:51,920
and way safer.

3191
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:54,719
I mean, the thing is, you already saw

3192
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:57,360
Azir on the first pick, and you picked

3193
02:15:54,719 --> 02:16:00,560
Brown Scanner into it. That's the worst

3194
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:02,719
idea you can have against Azir. And also

3195
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:05,199
as you mentioned TF covered on the top

3196
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:08,800
side so they could actually save Sante

3197
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:11,119
from like diving from Jay but they have

3198
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:13,520
Azir and Z on the other side. So it

3199
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:15,679
doesn't matter for T1 cuz they have all

3200
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:18,639
scaling lanes or all three lanes but

3201
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:20,560
also they have enough damage against

3202
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:22,480
Scanner and Braum. So I feel like just

3203
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,000
in general Jenji had just wrong plan

3204
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:25,679
against that comp.

3205
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,440
Yeah, definitely did feel that way. you

3206
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:29,040
know, if they got more ahead and some of

3207
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:30,560
their early game plays worked out, maybe

3208
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,920
they get enough of a lead where they get

3209
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:33,519
that snowball rolling. Kind of what you

3210
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:35,519
were talking about with the dual kill

3211
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:37,200
over at EWC, but it wasn't meant to be.

3212
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:39,359
Let's take a look at the first highlight

3213
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:42,559
here, which was 16 minutes in. T1 did

3214
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:44,160
take a big fight win at the Herald. This

3215
02:16:42,559 --> 02:16:45,760
is when things can become very

3216
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:47,359
disastrous for a composition like this

3217
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:49,040
for Genji when you lose control early,

3218
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:51,120
right? Even though the ultimate from

3219
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:53,519
Owner completely whiffs, they have no

3220
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,920
control. And look at Faker able to peel,

3221
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:57,200
keep three members of Genji away while

3222
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:59,120
also just kind of kiting back here.

3223
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,559
Sure, he has to flash ultimately, but

3224
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:02,639
fights like this where Ker gets the

3225
02:17:00,559 --> 02:17:04,719
knockups and Genji actually don't have

3226
02:17:02,639 --> 02:17:06,960
damage. Where's the damage? Still not

3227
02:17:04,719 --> 02:17:09,280
seeing any damage. T1 clean these up.

3228
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:11,760
Yeah, it's really easy for Genji to set

3229
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:14,240
up the fight with the tons of CCs like

3230
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:16,880
Scanner, TF, and Braum. But yeah, the

3231
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:18,960
damage is missing while T1 is just

3232
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:22,880
melting the front line with Zia and

3233
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:24,960
Azir. uh just no damage so you can't do

3234
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:26,559
anything. It's crazy that Jenji made

3235
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:28,080
these fights look so close still. Like

3236
02:17:26,559 --> 02:17:29,439
this team is so incredibly practiced

3237
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:30,960
with these types of compositions.

3238
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:32,319
They're really really comfortable with

3239
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:35,040
them. Even though no one is winning with

3240
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:36,800
TF right now, it's basically only Chobi.

3241
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:38,399
It is very impressive that that looked

3242
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:40,160
as close as it was and Chobi was almost

3243
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:42,319
even able to get that exit kill there.

3244
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:44,319
But ultimately, don't play on hard mode

3245
02:17:42,319 --> 02:17:46,000
against T1. This team's really good.

3246
02:17:44,319 --> 02:17:48,160
Yeah, T1 I think was very good at

3247
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,080
punishing in this game number two. Let's

3248
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:52,399
take a look at the fight just 2 minutes

3249
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:54,639
later. Uh 18 minutes in for highlight

3250
02:17:52,399 --> 02:17:56,559
number two, which was essentially the

3251
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:57,840
nail in the coffin in our minds. This

3252
02:17:56,559 --> 02:17:59,280
comp just got too far behind.

3253
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:01,760
Yeah, I feel like Jenji already knew

3254
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:03,760
that they cannot even outscale T1's team

3255
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:06,960
comp. So that's why they tried to cut

3256
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:09,040
off on the side lane, but T1 is the one

3257
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:11,439
who got the full control on the river

3258
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:14,880
side. So the backup wise is always

3259
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:17,280
easier for the the pressure side and you

3260
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:20,080
cannot really kill Zia on the on the

3261
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:22,719
other side as well. So it was really uh

3262
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:24,960
clean play by Ker and Guma as well. So I

3263
02:18:22,719 --> 02:18:26,639
mean just in general they had no choice.

3264
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:29,760
Yeah, I think you're 100% right with it.

3265
02:18:26,639 --> 02:18:32,160
Like Genji I feel in this moment 100%

3266
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:33,519
also aware this is not a strong play.

3267
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:35,359
This is not a strong position. The

3268
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:36,800
chances of this succeeding are

3269
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:39,280
incredibly low, but they're like maybe

3270
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:40,880
Keen outplays it. Maybe T1 mess it up.

3271
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:42,319
Maybe we actually find a way back in

3272
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:43,439
this game. Let's try to make a proactive

3273
02:18:42,319 --> 02:18:45,359
play here because if we just sit back

3274
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:46,800
and let the Azir become huge, we just

3275
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:48,240
lose the game anyways. So, that was kind

3276
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:50,240
of the last stand. And it's crazy that

3277
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:52,080
it's at 18 minutes in the game, Jeni

3278
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:53,200
know this one's likely over. Now, there

3279
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:55,760
were some shenanigans that happened

3280
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:57,679
after that. Ji almost got back in, but

3281
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:59,280
in theory, like at this point, T1 should

3282
02:18:57,679 --> 02:19:03,120
never have lost control. I just want to

3283
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:04,960
tell that T1 the key for T1 is

3284
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:06,880
stabilizing the laning phase. Uh the

3285
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:08,399
game one solo kill happened on the b

3286
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:10,160
side and I think that's snowball for

3287
02:19:08,399 --> 02:19:12,559
Genji really hard. So I feel like for

3288
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:14,479
the third game as well they need to find

3289
02:19:12,559 --> 02:19:16,479
some way to just stabilize the laning

3290
02:19:14,479 --> 02:19:18,800
phase and just get into the team fight

3291
02:19:16,479 --> 02:19:19,599
sequence where T1 is really strong on

3292
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:21,439
that part.

3293
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:23,599
Yeah. Well, we actually do have a close

3294
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:25,760
series now as it is one to one. Still a

3295
02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:27,439
lot of uh picks left as it's only game

3296
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:29,599
three of Fearless. Let's go back to the

3297
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:32,080
casters Atlas and Chronicler for the

3298
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:33,840
call.

3299
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:35,280
Exactly right Valdez. We're still

3300
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:36,479
looking forward to game number four that

3301
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:38,080
is going to be coming up. That's when

3302
02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:41,359
Fearless is really going to get

3303
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:43,599
exciting. Mainly because that's when Bro

3304
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:46,080
and DRX start playing. You know what I'm

3305
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:48,000
saying? As thankfully, we get a little

3306
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:51,120
bit of a look in on Sun, Clad, Templar,

3307
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:53,040
and Pony who are manning the Korean desk

3308
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,840
when it comes to the cast, which is

3309
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:57,120
super cool.

3310
02:19:53,840 --> 02:20:00,319
Really, the only thing that gets me with

3311
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:03,200
as cool as this arena is Yeah. is we

3312
02:20:00,319 --> 02:20:04,880
here at Low Park are just in and and you

3313
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:07,680
know what really the funniest thing to

3314
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:09,760
me is that our voices echo

3315
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:10,880
which never happens.

3316
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:12,640
Normally there's chatter, you know,

3317
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:15,040
there's fans, there's all that all

3318
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:17,680
that's fine. We have at least have a a

3319
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:19,520
proxy for that. But I can just hear you

3320
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:21,120
yelling and I can just hear it like

3321
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,359
Yeah. bouncing off the walls and it's

3322
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:24,880
like I'm yelling to no one. Yeah. It's

3323
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:26,720
like find some mole.

3324
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:28,560
It's it's an odd It's an odd sort of

3325
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:30,080
position. It's funny, but we do know

3326
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:32,479
that there's a giant crowd of people

3327
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:33,120
going absolutely bananas, so I'm not

3328
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:35,040
complaining.

3329
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:37,680
And we can hear it. And now it is the

3330
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:41,439
deciding match. Genji, they could make

3331
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:44,240
it to 28 series in a row. Uh, from the

3332
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:46,640
very beginning of this LCK season until

3333
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:48,240
now, uh, no matter whether it is an

3334
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:49,920
international competition or here

3335
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:52,399
domestically, they have not lost a

3336
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:54,560
series. They have lost many games though

3337
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:57,520
because they've been to five against so

3338
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:59,760
so many over the last few series. here

3339
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:02,560
all the way to the the distance of game

3340
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:04,080
three in this best of three. The first

3341
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:07,200
match up here in the legend group

3342
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:09,520
between GenG and T1 and thankfully we

3343
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:12,160
get the T1 home ground for it as well.

3344
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:15,200
Now LCK road show these road shows man

3345
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:18,080
it's so cool that we just some regular

3346
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:19,840
season games it's just an absolute

3347
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:22,000
banger and there are so many people here

3348
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:24,960
to witness it as well. It is just

3349
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,880
awesome stuff. Always glad to see the

3350
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:28,240
passion of the fans. Also always the

3351
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:30,880
best part of the internationals, right?

3352
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:33,920
Seeing fans from around the world just

3353
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:37,280
go crazy for their teams.

3354
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:40,399
And it's also very funny to me that uh

3355
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,880
Brennan lives in Inchan and had to drive

3356
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:41,520
here

3357
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:43,120
here in

3358
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:46,399
for a game that was happening in Inchan.

3359
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:49,120
Yeah. Although, as he's said many many

3360
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:51,680
times, Inchan is a gigantic place. And

3361
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:54,560
so, actually, it's probably just as far

3362
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:56,000
to drive to the home the home ground

3363
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,840
than it would be to drive to work. And

3364
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,800
in fact, it's probably faster to drive

3365
02:21:57,840 --> 02:22:03,200
to work is what he'd tell me. I imagine

3366
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:06,399
he hasn't said it just yet. That reminds

3367
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:09,600
me of in 2022 when I was in Busousan

3368
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:12,560
with my parents two weeks before MSI and

3369
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:15,359
then MSI the broadcast was in Berlin and

3370
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:16,720
then like we flew from from Soul to

3371
02:22:15,359 --> 02:22:19,520
Berlin.

3372
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:20,319
It's uh it doesn't feel very right. I

3373
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,479
It was funny though.

3374
02:22:20,319 --> 02:22:24,399
I once flew to Berlin for 2 days to

3375
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:25,439
commentate a tournament in Iceland. That

3376
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:27,520
that also happened.

3377
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:30,160
That didn't feel real. It was it was a

3378
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:32,240
very strange uh thing cuz there was no

3379
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:34,000
one in the other the LAC arena as well.

3380
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,640
Well, yeah. You left before the jet lag

3381
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,640
kicked in.

3382
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:38,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I I I was just

3383
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:39,760
never jetlagged throughout that entire

3384
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:40,880
experience cuz it wasn't in Germany long

3385
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:42,880
enough. It was like a fever dream.

3386
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:45,200
Exactly. Which is funny because one of

3387
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:48,399
my favorite memories of Atlas is him

3388
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:50,479
arriving in New York for 2022 and being

3389
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:52,479
like, we we met up, right? I at that

3390
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:54,960
point I'd already been to LA and he just

3391
02:22:52,479 --> 02:22:56,479
shows up. He's like, "Ma, this is like I

3392
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:58,000
think the evening off you coming in."

3393
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:59,280
You're like, "I'm actually feeling

3394
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,680
great. I don't think I'm going to be

3395
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,760
jetlagged at all." I'm like, "I'm glad

3396
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:04,080
you're here, Max. I I I'm glad you're

3397
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:05,439
doing well."

3398
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:08,160
And then he gave me the story about

3399
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:08,960
Raz's birthday party, which was

3400
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:10,240
absolutely

3401
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:12,399
And then obviously the conclusion of

3402
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:14,560
that story is that Atlas was in fact not

3403
02:23:12,399 --> 02:23:16,399
well and did really get boomed by

3404
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:18,560
Jetlack for like the next three days.

3405
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:20,160
Yeah. And also Raz had a real issue with

3406
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:22,640
a with a bill at a

3407
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:24,240
classic Raz. That's a real serious Raz

3408
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:25,120
situation. Oh man,

3409
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:27,040
I love Raz.

3410
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:28,720
Me too. Okay, we got some bands coming

3411
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:30,000
in here as Nocturn and Tier are both

3412
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:31,439
going to be taken away. This will be the

3413
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,800
first time that Genji have been on the

3414
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:34,720
blue side so far and they're going to

3415
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:38,560
continue down the route of banning the

3416
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:40,800
J4, which is an interesting one. Um, and

3417
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:42,800
in fact, it's only bans towards owner

3418
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:44,800
here on the blue side. So, a bit of

3419
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:49,359
respect given to the T1 jungler who has

3420
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:51,680
been playing very, very well of late.

3421
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:53,280
He's just so good, man. Owner. He's just

3422
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:55,200
he's just he's just good.

3423
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,240
Ah, the Maokai ban.

3424
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:58,160
Oh, that's that's

3425
02:23:56,240 --> 02:24:00,080
I love this is why Fearless is so good

3426
02:23:58,160 --> 02:24:01,680
because these bands come out and then

3427
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:04,800
you have to do the like the reverse

3428
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:06,160
puzzle to work out why the Maokai is now

3429
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:07,680
the champion that's being banned.

3430
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:09,840
It might be because they're afraid like

3431
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,319
Maokai Yon. That's a that's a classic

3432
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,160
combo.

3433
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:14,640
They've scrimmed too many LEC teams

3434
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:18,399
recently. Yeah, I mean we saw a lot of

3435
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:19,920
what was it like Maokai Yon Varys.

3436
02:24:18,399 --> 02:24:21,920
Yeah.

3437
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:24,000
We are B1.

3438
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:25,600
So then I think these three bands make a

3439
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,040
lot of sense because Senna doesn't like

3440
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:27,439
in the playing in any of them.

3441
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:29,600
Yep.

3442
02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:30,640
And Senna is obviously a very good pick

3443
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:32,960
right now.

3444
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:36,080
And you also get the opportunity

3445
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:37,600
to uh two three pick Trundle tank which

3446
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:39,280
is really strong.

3447
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:41,600
Zixs Camille.

3448
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:42,880
Oh Zix Camille sounds fun. In fact,

3449
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:44,080
Ziggs just sounds like a really good

3450
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:45,840
pick into the center and then you can

3451
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:47,200
just craft a comp around it. If you pick

3452
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:48,960
Rise, you're probably less likely to

3453
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:50,000
pick Ziggs,

3454
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:52,479
which is sad, but that's okay.

3455
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,280
You're going to get like Rise versus uh

3456
02:24:52,479 --> 02:24:56,399
what, like Gallo? Chovy Gallo. I I would

3457
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:59,280
sign up for that.

3458
02:24:56,399 --> 02:25:00,880
Ooh. And then you could uh I mean, that

3459
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:02,399
is another opportunity for a relatively

3460
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:04,720
low damage composition. But when you

3461
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:07,200
have a Senna, she does hit that critical

3462
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:09,280
mass where you can protect her and do a

3463
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:10,800
heck of a lot of damage.

3464
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:12,800
What does owner's pick going into?

3465
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:14,080
He's smiling a lot, Chronicle. I'm

3466
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:15,120
worried about that. Oh, instead it's

3467
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:17,840
just going to be his classic, the

3468
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:20,479
Zenzou. Maybe uh they're just wondering

3469
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:22,960
like why did you ban all these junglers

3470
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:24,240
and leave up my favorite one and that is

3471
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:26,000
because Trungle has a really good match

3472
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:27,920
up into the Zenzou. So maybe that's what

3473
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,120
Canyon was angling for. Yeah, there

3474
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:30,560
there's a there's a bunch of reasons,

3475
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,840
right? Like Owner is the best Zenz out

3476
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:33,520
in the LCK, I think, by a pretty

3477
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:34,960
substantial margin. He's crazy good on

3478
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,240
the pick. His team fighting in

3479
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:38,640
particular, I think, is what really sets

3480
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:40,160
him apart. Uh, but it is a pick that has

3481
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:41,600
a much harder time getting at the center

3482
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:44,000
reliably than any of the other three

3483
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:45,760
picks that were banned. So, I do think

3484
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:48,000
giving that over makes a decent amount

3485
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:49,920
of sense. This also makes the draft

3486
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,760
possibly a little awkward for T1 cuz if

3487
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:52,880
they don't pick a support counter pick

3488
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:55,600
here, there's going to be some bands

3489
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:57,680
going towards that I do imagine. And

3490
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:59,040
now, will K can I think for Keny you

3491
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:00,640
don't really need to pick her? I would

3492
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:02,160
like a Chroy pick unless they're going

3493
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:04,960
to run a pirate test of Trundle which is

3494
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:07,200
good into poverty as well as the Zenzo.

3495
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:10,160
So, I do think it it's warranted. It's

3496
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:11,840
also not blind Trundle, which Canyon

3497
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:12,720
fans of all ages have. Uh,

3498
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:14,720
oh god.

3499
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:15,760
Do you remember that game that got

3500
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:17,439
disappeared?

3501
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:19,040
Oh, game five in the world finals.

3502
02:26:17,439 --> 02:26:20,640
No, no, no, no, no. The the game where

3503
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,080
he played Trundle and the game

3504
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:24,800
disappeared.

3505
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,280
We had to remake the entire game and the

3506
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:27,040
entire draft.

3507
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:28,800
He got like free kills in like the first

3508
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:30,640
straight up ran the early game. It was

3509
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:33,920
the best game that he had all year

3510
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:34,720
because it was like 2023 or two or

3511
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:36,240
something like that.

3512
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:38,240
I think it was free cuz I think two that

3513
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:39,280
were still consistently good.

3514
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:40,080
I think it was free.

3515
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:41,840
Yeah, I think it sounds like

3516
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:44,560
the struggle bus really started

3517
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:45,040
severe struggle bus scenario as that's a

3518
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:46,319
Gragas.

3519
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:48,000
Is that Gragas support?

3520
02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:49,680
It feels like Gragas.

3521
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,600
It's it's obviously a flex, right? I

3522
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:52,880
think most likely this is carry and it

3523
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:55,040
will this will go towards the bot side

3524
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:56,560
of the map. But it also does mean that

3525
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:59,200
obviously as we all know Dorne is an

3526
02:26:56,560 --> 02:27:01,760
amazing Gragas player so they can flex

3527
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:04,800
it as there is indeed that Gallo ban

3528
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:07,200
should not come as a surprise. Nope.

3529
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:07,600
Uh see what uh the next answer is going

3530
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:09,680
to be.

3531
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:11,280
Gallio Victor I don't think you're

3532
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:13,439
really too worried about Casopia pulling

3533
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:15,040
out or Chovi pulling out like a Casio. I

3534
02:27:13,439 --> 02:27:16,160
also don't think Casio is that good.

3535
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:18,240
We've seen this counter pick be

3536
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:20,240
attempted a bunch of times but I think

3537
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:22,319
the pick needs a lot of setup to really

3538
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:24,240
work. Caitlin going to be taken away.

3539
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:26,800
So, we're going to be digging into the

3540
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:29,840
80 carry champion pools quite far.

3541
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:31,280
Caitlyn Jinx, maybe. I think a Jinx band

3542
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:33,120
would make a lot of sense because that's

3543
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:35,200
the last champion that Gumushi is well

3544
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,439
and truly known for that will be left up

3545
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:39,280
and available. Also, I I always look at

3546
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:41,040
picks that really outrange the Sana cuz

3547
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,399
I think that's her only true weakness is

3548
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:44,399
early on if she doesn't get the stack

3549
02:27:42,399 --> 02:27:46,000
because you just outrange your in space.

3550
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:47,359
Yeah, cuz you can deal with aggressive

3551
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,200
lanes, right? You do have still have a

3552
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:50,720
decent amount of sustain. Want to mind

3553
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:52,479
the Jinx banners. The Aurora also going

3554
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:54,240
to get taken away from Chov. It's the

3555
02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:54,960
Poppy instead.

3556
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:57,520
Interesting.

3557
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:59,680
Which I guess their read is that this is

3558
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:01,359
a top lane Grager. So just a blind for

3559
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:04,080
Doran.

3560
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:05,280
Well, Smoulder is hovered. Oh, okay.

3561
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:06,640
Felio.

3562
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:08,960
Oh, it's not going to be the Jinx this

3563
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:13,120
time around. And instead, we are taken

3564
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:15,439
200 years into this draft.

3565
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:16,880
I'm glad. I really hope Aphelios is like

3566
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:18,399
back to state. I like the champion a

3567
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:20,880
lot.

3568
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:23,439
We'll see how this one plays out.

3569
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:25,120
We get to talk about severe and grabs

3570
02:28:23,439 --> 02:28:27,840
and stuff again. That's kind of fun.

3571
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:30,479
Also, you do have the ability to very

3572
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:31,840
early on bully the lane, right? He's not

3573
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:35,120
what I was thinking of, but does have a

3574
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:36,880
good amount of range as

3575
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:39,200
Let's do it.

3576
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:40,800
Okay, we do need some.

3577
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,760
It's just like Victor.

3578
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:45,840
Ah, Aurelian Soul.

3579
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:47,200
could actually be an we know that loves

3580
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:48,880
to lock this pick,

3581
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:50,080
but the Casio that you were talking

3582
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:52,240
about

3583
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:53,680
is a consideration. This is something

3584
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:54,479
that he actually played a fair bit back

3585
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:56,240
in the Griffin days.

3586
02:28:54,479 --> 02:28:57,359
It is a short range comp. I think this

3587
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:58,560
makes the most Yeah,

3588
02:28:57,359 --> 02:28:59,200
it feels less good.

3589
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:00,479
It's boring,

3590
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:02,399
but it's it's probably

3591
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:04,319
I do I do also think like into the comp

3592
02:29:02,399 --> 02:29:04,640
that T1 has, it is actually really good.

3593
02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:06,319
Yeah,

3594
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:08,560
just being able to force them to do

3595
02:29:06,319 --> 02:29:10,000
something or you just poke them down.

3596
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:12,880
It's also a good late game insurance

3597
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:15,760
policy together with the Senna. feels

3598
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:18,160
less good picking something like a uh re

3599
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:19,600
here, but the nautilus is potentially a

3600
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:22,000
possibility if they want engage, but

3601
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:24,000
instead it's Thresh. Oh man, we haven't

3602
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,520
seen this for ages. This is something

3603
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
that gumishi carrier used to be great at

3604
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:27,520
in the past.

3605
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,160
It's the 2022 era, right?

3606
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:32,080
It really is. That was spring 2022.

3607
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:34,319
That was a pretty good year for T1. If

3608
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:35,920
you just don't look at the game five

3609
02:29:34,319 --> 02:29:38,640
between them and DRX

3610
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:39,760
or the game five between them and RNG.

3611
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:42,319
Yeah.

3612
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:44,399
But otherwise, great. Brilliant year.

3613
02:29:42,319 --> 02:29:45,920
Brilliant year. Um, in fact, they went

3614
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:47,520
undefeated, I'm pretty sure, in spring.

3615
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:48,720
Like, that was the last time any team

3616
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:50,960
that was the first time any team went

3617
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:52,880
undefeated in in a in a split.

3618
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:54,479
Yeah, I I I I think that their

3619
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:56,080
performance in that split also was

3620
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:58,080
crazy. That one it was to me there was a

3621
02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:00,800
lot of subbing, right? Like I think that

3622
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:02,160
was a little actually the year after I

3623
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:04,720
think they were way crazier with the

3624
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:06,080
double AD carry meta, but this was what

3625
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:08,240
they made their name on, right? Like

3626
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:12,000
this is as you highlight when GMA

3627
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:13,520
started after his debut in uh in 2021.

3628
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,439
This is where they really made a name

3629
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:17,120
for themselves with this specific combo.

3630
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:19,760
That said, I'm looking at this Genji

3631
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:21,439
comp. We have Chovi on an insane damage

3632
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:23,439
threat with laning pressure. We have

3633
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:25,359
Keen on Renekton. We have Kenyon with a

3634
02:30:23,439 --> 02:30:26,800
counter matchup and then we have Ruler

3635
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:29,120
on Senna.

3636
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:31,120
Yeah, it's um this is going to be a

3637
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:33,840
little bit less of the Genji doesn't

3638
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,280
have enough damage and more of maybe

3639
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:38,000
Genji has too much damage. which we'll

3640
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:40,720
just have to see as T1 still certainly a

3641
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:43,359
lot of opportunities to make plays, find

3642
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:45,359
team fights, and get things done. I

3643
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:47,200
don't think this is by any means a draft

3644
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:50,200
gap. Let's jump onto the rift for game

3645
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:50,200
three.

3646
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:56,880
Yeah, I I needed to give them a chance,

3647
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:57,920
right? I need to give him a chance.

3648
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:59,840
Might be happening for a while.

3649
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:01,439
And also, I had it like ringing in my

3650
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:03,359
ears. I don't think this is a draft gap,

3651
02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:05,600
but if I was to be honest,

3652
02:31:03,359 --> 02:31:07,840
many unsung

3653
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,319
is good for T1.

3654
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:12,000
No,

3655
02:31:08,319 --> 02:31:15,040
but honesty often isn't what you should

3656
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:17,439
do as a commentator. You know,

3657
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:18,960
sometimes it's got to be about, you

3658
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:20,720
know, making sure that you have the

3659
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:22,560
right amount of hype on both sides.

3660
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:24,399
What we really want as a commentator is

3661
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:26,479
that afterwards you go, you know, and

3662
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:28,080
then you get called bias from, if you

3663
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:29,040
get biased from both sides, that way,

3664
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:30,080
you know, you smashed it.

3665
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:30,560
Yeah. Right. But that's always what

3666
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:33,840
you're looking for.

3667
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:35,280
Or you've uh you've pingponged too hard.

3668
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:36,560
That's the other way.

3669
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,080
You know, like you've just gone a little

3670
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:39,520
bit too hard in both directions.

3671
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:40,960
No, but if you go too hard in both

3672
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:42,880
directions, it it

3673
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:44,640
it does mean you're not biased. You just

3674
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:45,600
might be not that great at your job.

3675
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:47,280
That's all I'm saying.

3676
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:48,880
Well, now you're adding new insecurity

3677
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:50,319
for me. That's so mean.

3678
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:51,760
That's okay. It's okay. You've only got

3679
02:31:50,319 --> 02:31:54,479
a few months left.

3680
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:56,560
You can figure it out.

3681
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:57,120
Oh my god. Atlas,

3682
02:31:56,560 --> 02:31:58,000
I'm going to run.

3683
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:59,920
Come on, man.

3684
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:01,359
I really did. I really I do think that

3685
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:03,280
now that we've gotten to summer, I feel

3686
02:32:01,359 --> 02:32:05,120
like the the the jokes are going to keep

3687
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,359
getting ramped up and we're not.

3688
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:09,120
We have not even nearly began yet.

3689
02:32:07,359 --> 02:32:10,960
No, no, it's going to be good.

3690
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:12,399
There's a cute little play there as Dur

3691
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:14,479
doing that thing where you press the one

3692
02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:16,319
button that you have for like 20 seconds

3693
02:32:14,479 --> 02:32:17,359
and then uh and then you just go back to

3694
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:19,200
the brush.

3695
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:21,439
Yeah, Senna does actually have a quite a

3696
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:23,600
strong level one. Uh does offset by the

3697
02:32:21,439 --> 02:32:26,720
fact that Alistar's level one is not

3698
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:29,520
good. And then for Gman carrier, looking

3699
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:30,960
at the sums, we do have ghost. So team

3700
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:32,800
fight focus there.

3701
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:34,160
Pretty cool law match up as well cuz we

3702
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:36,479
got Senna versus Thresh.

3703
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:39,280
It is. It would be really cool if like

3704
02:32:36,479 --> 02:32:40,560
Carrier could use the lantern on Senna

3705
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:42,319
offensively

3706
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:43,280
and she just gets sucked in.

3707
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:44,560
Oh, that' be great.

3708
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:46,080
Yeah. And like she's just not in the

3709
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:49,359
game for the rest of the game. Maybe

3710
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:50,720
Riot should put that in as carrier not

3711
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:52,240
going to quite find anything here as he

3712
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:56,080
picks the gap. The flash does come in,

3713
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:57,520
but Carrier does manage to flash away.

3714
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:59,120
Not exactly the play that we've wanted

3715
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:00,880
to see there. Did pick the gap quite

3716
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:03,439
nicely. So, that is six points if he's

3717
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:05,200
in Australia playing football.

3718
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:07,439
Uh outside of that, um it's just not

3719
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:09,680
going to be too much. Big whips is going

3720
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:10,800
to not be the end of the world when it

3721
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:13,120
comes to summoners. But it does mean

3722
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:14,960
that Genji and Duro

3723
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:16,479
any trading they can do is good for them

3724
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:19,120
as long as they don't get dove because

3725
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:21,920
again Senna is relying on finding these

3726
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:23,680
trades and just continuously scrapping

3727
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:26,240
to actually get off to a good stack

3728
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:28,880
start. So any auto right second auto

3729
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:30,640
that GMA can get any Q it is just going

3730
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:32,240
to make a big difference as we get later

3731
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:33,760
into the game. So Kerat going for that

3732
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:35,280
play and not all working out. Not going

3733
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:37,600
to have too big of an immediate impact.

3734
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:42,080
But those are the moments that Genji is

3735
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:43,920
going to make good use of as uh the only

3736
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:46,000
matchup that I think truly is just

3737
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:47,520
really nice for T1 is top because the

3738
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,520
the Renekton pickup to me doesn't make

3739
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:52,479
that much sense cuz Gragas actually

3740
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:54,240
particularly with Grass is one of the OG

3741
02:33:52,479 --> 02:33:56,160
Renekton quoteunquote counters. You

3742
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:57,520
don't really counter Renekton but but

3743
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:59,359
one of the champions together with like

3744
02:33:57,520 --> 02:34:02,240
the or that just doesn't really care,

3745
02:33:59,359 --> 02:34:03,840
right? you sustain through, you can

3746
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:05,280
always disengage from him. He doesn't

3747
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:07,520
really get to frame you the way he does

3748
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:09,680
with a lot of other picks. So that is a

3749
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:12,319
bit of a questionable one is they are

3750
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:14,080
very aware of this.

3751
02:34:12,319 --> 02:34:16,240
Not going to be looking to take any of

3752
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:18,240
the bait. Will also spot owner here.

3753
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:20,560
Yeah, that ward is getting so much value

3754
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:21,920
here for Genji as Faker is also going to

3755
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:24,399
be roaming down but just to get a little

3756
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:26,640
ward and the back is going to come on

3757
02:34:24,399 --> 02:34:28,479
through. So Genji don't know that owner

3758
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:30,000
has gone back home. That might give T1 a

3759
02:34:28,479 --> 02:34:31,520
little bit of an angle, but instead

3760
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,880
they're going to look for a back timer.

3761
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:35,520
I wonder whether this is going to be a

3762
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:38,080
bit of a lane swap. Could potentially be

3763
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:42,160
as here is Doran enjoying the counter

3764
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:44,800
show. I don't carrier cancelled or well,

3765
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:45,840
you do need Yeah, early levels are up,

3766
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:46,800
right? You do

3767
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:48,479
kidding. It was just um

3768
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:50,399
I mean Keen having a good time.

3769
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:52,080
I do think that back when it really was

3770
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:53,359
a counter was when the Gragas passive

3771
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:54,960
was a lot stronger than it is now. We

3772
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:56,800
did obviously see that get nerfed.

3773
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:59,680
Yeah. Uh I forgot when it was like I

3774
02:34:56,800 --> 02:35:01,680
want to say like a year year ago maybe

3775
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:03,359
maybe a little bit shorter but did get

3776
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:05,280
because the sustain was obviously very

3777
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:08,880
oppressive as the lane swap does come

3778
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:10,399
through. Looks like the TPS are or the

3779
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:13,200
TP is just going to come through here

3780
02:35:10,399 --> 02:35:15,280
from Doran to make his way towards this

3781
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:17,040
lane and then I imagine Keen is going to

3782
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:18,720
try and like get the shove him. I don't

3783
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:19,280
know if GMA Yeah, GMA is not letting

3784
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:20,880
him.

3785
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:21,600
Yeah, it does have Grabbit and Primed as

3786
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:24,560
well. So

3787
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:26,080
but can make his way back. Wave state is

3788
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:28,080
a bit awkward for Ruler here because

3789
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:29,520
again Goomba did uh get the freeze but

3790
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:31,359
he did take a decent amount of damage so

3791
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:32,720
we'll see. Yeah, a little bit of a

3792
02:35:31,359 --> 02:35:34,640
freeze on both sides actually. The

3793
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:36,880
cannon does come on in and the cannon

3794
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:38,560
doesn't survive on Genji's side of the

3795
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:41,120
map. So that bottom lane is at least

3796
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:43,840
going to be pushing taking some death

3797
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:45,280
rays here. Does miss that Q but I don't

3798
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:47,280
think the Rise is too worried about

3799
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:48,800
what's going on.

3800
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,960
It doesn't have TP anymore though. So

3801
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:53,680
like this damage does actually stick.

3802
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:55,760
Chov Chovi also has gone for comet which

3803
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:58,479
is interesting. We've mostly seen ARY in

3804
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:59,840
these type of setups as

3805
02:35:58,479 --> 02:36:00,640
H. That looked a bit weird. I don't know

3806
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:04,240
what was going on.

3807
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:06,479
I think it's hex flash and then

3808
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:07,680
okay always frightens me a little bit

3809
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:09,200
but that was a hex flash.

3810
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,479
Yeah, but before that he was just in the

3811
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:11,359
hex flash animation just kind of

3812
02:36:10,479 --> 02:36:13,200
Yeah. You're just partying

3813
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:15,439
zoning around. Yeah. Partying party

3814
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:17,920
fresh. And honestly, when you take

3815
02:36:15,439 --> 02:36:19,359
Hexplash, if you haven't just used it,

3816
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,479
it's available and you're not just using

3817
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:21,840
it, then a mistake.

3818
02:36:20,479 --> 02:36:24,240
I don't know enough about fresh skins,

3819
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:26,240
but like imagine surprise party fiddle

3820
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:27,520
sticks, but it's fresh. Like his lantern

3821
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,000
is a piñata.

3822
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:29,760
Oh my god.

3823
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:32,479
And when you click it,

3824
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:34,319
like candy comes up. That

3825
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:35,680
That's pretty That sounds good, right?

3826
02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:38,080
And actually, you could have like the

3827
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:40,000
thresh uh the hook like the death

3828
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:41,920
sentence also like when it hits a

3829
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,600
champion like confetti comes out. No,

3830
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:45,280
no, no. It's a kazoo. You know, like the

3831
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:46,720
the birthday like a

3832
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:48,560
Yeah. Yeah. Like the sound that the

3833
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:50,399
crows storm makes as Carrier going to

3834
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:53,680
throw a lantern over to Ona and the wind

3835
02:36:50,399 --> 02:36:55,760
becomes lightning and not much else. But

3836
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:58,399
uh they do get the heal. So there is at

3837
02:36:55,760 --> 02:37:00,880
least that as Canyon's over here eating

3838
02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:03,840
some shellfish

3839
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:06,479
and he'll take a dragon as well in

3840
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:08,640
rebute.

3841
02:37:06,479 --> 02:37:10,240
That's all right. Fishi going grab a

3842
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:13,040
white gun. Carrier throws another death

3843
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:15,120
sentence a little bit. Waywood just does

3844
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:16,800
the rage ignite, but Owner is there.

3845
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:18,399
This is setting up for a bit of a dive

3846
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:20,640
as they will now.

3847
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:21,920
Yeah, Faker in amongst it. Teleport is

3848
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:23,439
going to come down from Keen, but I

3849
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:26,080
believe that one was interrupted.

3850
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:27,120
Another one as never mind not actually

3851
02:37:26,080 --> 02:37:29,120
going to come on through there. And they

3852
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,560
do manage to get that first kill. Faker

3853
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:32,800
locking down first blood as Owner is

3854
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:34,640
able to flash away as well. And even

3855
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:36,160
Doran will survive as the Dominus did

3856
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:37,760
come on through there as Canyon takes

3857
02:37:36,160 --> 02:37:40,160
about 15 years, but he will be able to

3858
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:41,280
take down this dragon. And they do, you

3859
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:42,800
know, stick around in lanes. There's

3860
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:44,560
going to be a wave missed in mid, but a

3861
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:47,920
double kill in the top lane and this

3862
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:51,359
whole wave dying. A great start for T1.

3863
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:53,600
Big win for T1. It's the use of Rise,

3864
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:55,680
his ability to impact the side lane

3865
02:37:53,600 --> 02:38:00,000
there. It's Faker just like he did on

3866
02:37:55,680 --> 02:38:01,680
Denny in game one teleporting up able to

3867
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,319
take the kill and Doran also canceling

3868
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:05,680
that TP if Keen shows up to that play. I

3869
02:38:04,319 --> 02:38:06,160
don't think it's going to go nearly as

3870
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:08,399
well.

3871
02:38:06,160 --> 02:38:10,080
Yeah, it's a big one

3872
02:38:08,399 --> 02:38:11,680
and understanding that that's where he

3873
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:13,120
was going to be as well. Really glad

3874
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:14,240
that Jonas Strong had the pan down as

3875
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:14,800
we're going to check out the replay one

3876
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:16,720
more time.

3877
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:18,080
And Ruler stepping up. I don't think it

3878
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:20,319
would have made a difference if he

3879
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:22,880
didn't with four man. I think this dive

3880
02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:25,840
can just always work. And then here

3881
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:29,040
the attempt from Keem and Dor. Oh, the

3882
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:30,319
double. That was beautiful. No way.

3883
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:32,319
Keem was ever going to be able to find

3884
02:38:30,319 --> 02:38:33,760
it there. Filter available. Could

3885
02:38:32,319 --> 02:38:35,120
probably outplay his dive, but instead

3886
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:36,399
owner doesn't even die. He would have

3887
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:38,479
taken the death. Would have been no

3888
02:38:36,399 --> 02:38:40,399
problem at all, but he's clean with it.

3889
02:38:38,479 --> 02:38:41,120
Yep. They also take two uh two turret

3890
02:38:40,399 --> 02:38:41,600
plates as well.

3891
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:44,560
Yep.

3892
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:46,399
And Gushi now with that Moonlight Vigil

3893
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:48,479
moves up, spots his control ward. That

3894
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:50,560
does give Jen G bit of a heads up here

3895
02:38:48,479 --> 02:38:51,680
as Canyon just kind of ignoring

3896
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:53,680
everything else that's happening on the

3897
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:56,080
map. He is a PVE player at this point in

3898
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:59,040
time as Doran and Keen just partying

3899
02:38:56,080 --> 02:39:02,640
here towards bottom side. Some grubs

3900
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:05,040
being taken a hook going to go wide

3901
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:07,600
and Gumushi does have red white. That is

3902
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:09,760
a scary opportunity here as slice out

3903
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:12,960
here from Keen. Doran without very much

3904
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:14,800
mana and will get ruthlessly preded

3905
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:16,479
which I don't think is a great verb but

3906
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:18,399
it's fine. You know there's a new

3907
02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:20,000
Predator movie that's coming out. The

3908
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:20,880
trailer looked good. Yeah, it looked

3909
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
kind of interesting.

3910
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:23,040
You know, I've never seen any of the

3911
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,600
Predator movies.

3912
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:24,479
Really?

3913
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:25,600
Should I? Are they good?

3914
02:39:24,479 --> 02:39:26,080
Yeah, you definitely good good action

3915
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:28,319
movies.

3916
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:31,359
Carl Weathers, man. Oh, it's the iconic

3917
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:33,120
like uh the the shake the hold arms.

3918
02:39:31,359 --> 02:39:35,040
Oh, no. I've I've seen I I don't need

3919
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,760
you talking about I've seen clips and

3920
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,240
like I

3921
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:37,840
Yeah. Yeah.

3922
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:40,000
Biosmos. I've watched a lot of movies,

3923
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:40,880
but then you get to see it in context if

3924
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,640
you actually watch them.

3925
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:43,760
That sounds fun.

3926
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:45,600
It's all right. Carrier going to find

3927
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:47,120
one. does get the cleanse out from Ruler

3928
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:48,800
this time around and there's the flash

3929
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:50,720
out as well. Running out of summoner

3930
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:51,280
spells here as gravit going to hold duro

3931
02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:53,359
in place.

3932
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:55,280
Not a dive. Moonlight vigil will connect

3933
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:57,840
and owner's coming in. I've seen this

3934
02:39:55,280 --> 02:40:00,000
play before but uh Faker is not going to

3935
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:02,319
be able to move over the pillar pillar

3936
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,520
as Canyon looking to try and get himself

3937
02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:05,920
out of here and in fact not going to

3938
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:08,319
take the risk. Didn't want to get

3939
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:09,920
charged audaciously or even prisoned

3940
02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:11,200
runically.

3941
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:11,840
Okay, now you're now you're stretching

3942
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:13,439
it out.

3943
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:15,680
I'm really trying. started with I'm

3944
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:17,120
predatoring ruthlessly, but now we're

3945
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:18,720
we're

3946
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:20,479
That started a fun conversation that

3947
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:20,800
involved car weathers, though. That's

3948
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:21,760
kind of

3949
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:23,359
Oh, it was a win.

3950
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:24,240
I felt like it was positive. That just

3951
02:40:23,359 --> 02:40:25,920
went way too far.

3952
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:27,520
Let's Let's be real. As fun as

3953
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:28,319
internationals are, it's fun to just

3954
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:30,640
yap.

3955
02:40:28,319 --> 02:40:32,000
Yeah. All right. Canyon comes on over

3956
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:33,280
and looks to take a bite out of Faker.

3957
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,319
Does manage to do that, but isn't going

3958
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:39,600
to be able to kill him.

3959
02:40:36,319 --> 02:40:41,280
Sorry. Walk back to back to Yapp.

3960
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:43,520
Okay. Now you're Now you're crossing a

3961
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:44,479
line. Okay, come on.

3962
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:45,200
He did do that though.

3963
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:47,040
He did do that.

3964
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:49,359
It's kind of like Wario, you know, where

3965
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:50,960
he has the, you know, dislocated jaw

3966
02:40:49,359 --> 02:40:52,560
thing.

3967
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:55,439
Didn't Wario do that? What What was the

3968
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:57,200
What game was that even in

3969
02:40:55,439 --> 02:40:58,880
aware? I don't think I don't want to get

3970
02:40:57,200 --> 02:41:00,160
started about Donkey Kong Bonanza cuz

3971
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:02,399
like I feel like that's going to be the

3972
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:03,439
whole the whole conversation for and we

3973
02:41:02,399 --> 02:41:05,280
we have a game to cast.

3974
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:06,319
I haven't played it yet, but I do know

3975
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,520
it is good, man.

3976
02:41:06,319 --> 02:41:10,240
Do you know what's the best thing about

3977
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:12,800
it? Dunkey is making like consistent

3978
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:15,439
videos about had like it's like been one

3979
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:16,479
a day for the last like 5 days. It's so

3980
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:18,319
good.

3981
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:20,880
Just give me more donkey content. That's

3982
02:41:18,319 --> 02:41:23,120
all I need.

3983
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:25,439
Just one about an ice bridge.

3984
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:26,960
Oh, it is playing around an ice bridge.

3985
02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:29,359
I I'm going to spoil everything, man. We

3986
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:30,479
need to We need to find a different

3987
02:41:29,359 --> 02:41:31,359
Okay. Yeah, Ruler could be in a little

3988
02:41:30,479 --> 02:41:32,800
bit of trouble here as the death

3989
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:35,520
sentence is going to get thrown out in a

3990
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:36,560
random direction. Just trying to pick an

3991
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:38,080
angle there.

3992
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:40,160
You know how sometimes you've downloaded

3993
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:41,359
your opponent and every hook hits? Yeah,

3994
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:43,280
rule is downloaded.

3995
02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:46,640
Carrier does not have any connection,

3996
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:49,120
bro. He is he his data is not working.

3997
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:49,840
His Wi-Fi is sluggish and we don't know

3998
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:51,600
why.

3999
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:53,040
Yeah, that was a I I don't even know

4000
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:54,960
what that like

4001
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:56,880
there was obviously a level of like

4002
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:59,040
thinking thinking thinking. It wasn't

4003
02:41:56,880 --> 02:42:01,359
just like an error. It was I just don't

4004
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,760
know what the possible positive outcome

4005
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:02,960
could have been.

4006
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:03,359
Just keep predicting. Yeah.

4007
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:06,160
Yeah.

4008
02:42:03,359 --> 02:42:07,520
So, this game to me is kind of a repeat

4009
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:09,280
of game number two.

4010
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:09,600
Oh, there it is. That's Alistister

4011
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:11,200
though.

4012
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:13,200
Yeah. So he's going to get a pulverize

4013
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:14,720
off. There is a teleport in though as

4014
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:18,000
the Gragas is coming down. Moonlight

4015
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:20,560
Vigil will do a damage and the Gragas is

4016
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:22,640
here guys. Howdy Gragas.

4017
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:24,240
Howdy Doran. It's going to be

4018
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:27,760
still. Yeah, there's no they they can

4019
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:30,479
definitely pressure here but can they

4020
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:32,000
get the turret before the Trundle and

4021
02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:32,880
Renekton

4022
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,560
get it?

4023
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:36,000
They don't have white guns. I think that

4024
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:37,439
actually matters a lot. There is another

4025
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:40,000
minion wave that is coming up and this

4026
02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:41,439
one's going to take a little while as

4027
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,880
Arcane Storm in the mid lane is going to

4028
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:44,080
be pushing Faker around. I think it is

4029
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:45,280
going to be first turret going over to

4030
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:47,200
T1 though.

4031
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:48,960
Oh, okay. Yeah, with white guns

4032
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:51,600
definitely going to be able to get that

4033
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:53,840
crescendum over and Kumushi with a bunch

4034
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:54,080
of extra money and he'll deny the cannon

4035
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:55,680
as well.

4036
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:58,240
Oh god, he's going to be up like what

4037
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:59,520
like one and a one point 1.5.

4038
02:42:58,240 --> 02:43:01,280
Yeah,

4039
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:02,880
feels pretty good. Kane also extending

4040
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:04,160
his advantage as Duro will be able to

4041
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,760
get he doesn't even need vision because

4042
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:06,960
they can see Faker on that ward but

4043
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:09,120
nothing they can do about it. Control

4044
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:11,040
ward goes over just to make sure. So

4045
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:12,720
that is going to be the dragon secured

4046
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:16,000
here for T1. It's going to be an

4047
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:20,720
infernal soul here for game three. And

4048
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:22,640
the gold ahead for T1 about 800 but it's

4049
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:24,800
not a massive lead. This is feeling like

4050
02:43:22,640 --> 02:43:27,359
a much less like oh this is kind of

4051
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:28,640
doomed for a lot of extraneous reasons

4052
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:30,560
this time around. This is some honest

4053
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:32,319
League of Legends we've got for us here.

4054
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:34,800
This This is And both teams can look at

4055
02:43:32,319 --> 02:43:36,560
their com outskilled. So, you know what

4056
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:36,800
that means, Atlas? We're in the long

4057
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:38,479
haul.

4058
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:41,920
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

4059
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:43,840
Can we get an elder? Two elders. Maybe

4060
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:45,359
T1 can break their record of their

4061
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:46,800
longest game ever. What do you reckon?

4062
02:43:45,359 --> 02:43:48,240
93 minutes.

4063
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:50,240
You know that's never happening.

4064
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:52,800
Yeah, it's so sad.

4065
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:55,120
Oh, wow. Carrier's figured it out now.

4066
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:55,840
The lantern doesn't quite work. And the

4067
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:58,399
the

4068
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:59,760
Have you seen the joke edits of like

4069
02:43:58,399 --> 02:44:01,359
where like where like someone like

4070
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:02,880
tepee's into a brush and then like

4071
02:44:01,359 --> 02:44:04,800
flashes out and it's like oh it's the

4072
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:05,200
ghost of that's how these players are

4073
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:07,439
looking.

4074
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:09,200
Yeah. I feel like we're just not good

4075
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:11,439
enough to understand what carrier is

4076
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:12,640
trying to do. So I just I just

4077
02:44:11,439 --> 02:44:14,000
I refuse.

4078
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:15,439
This is this is they're going to get

4079
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:18,640
this turret as well. like we we've been

4080
02:44:15,439 --> 02:44:20,399
meaning a lot but T1 actually have done

4081
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:21,600
an exceptional job of something we've

4082
02:44:20,399 --> 02:44:23,680
criticized a lot of team for

4083
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:25,279
specifically with the Selios especially

4084
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,640
with these white guns. So one of the

4085
02:44:25,279 --> 02:44:28,240
things we always talk about with Zigs

4086
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:30,160
one of the things that infuriates

4087
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:32,240
I mean it's a Caitlin and Jinx thing as

4088
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:34,000
well and they've done this with GMA so

4089
02:44:32,240 --> 02:44:35,760
many times on these picks

4090
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,359
and it's why we see the gold lead

4091
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:39,359
actually starting to ready balloon

4092
02:44:37,359 --> 02:44:42,319
they're very happy to just siege away.

4093
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:44,080
Well, here's a Dominus here for Keen as

4094
02:44:42,319 --> 02:44:45,200
he looks to try and defend, but he's not

4095
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:46,880
just standing around. Wants to be able

4096
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:48,880
to dodge some of the CC. The play does

4097
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:50,800
come back though, so he can't dodge all

4098
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:52,240
all of it even if the hook does go wide.

4099
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:54,080
Still Canyon is going to be able to eat

4100
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:56,080
this turret.

4101
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:57,840
So, the gold lead remains manageable.

4102
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:59,840
Yeah, it's not the end of the world for

4103
02:44:57,840 --> 02:45:01,680
Genji, but I do like T1 being this

4104
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:03,520
proactive with pushing and again playing

4105
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:06,800
around the pushing strength of

4106
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:08,960
particularly the Zenza as well as the

4107
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:10,720
Ailos. There's also the added benefit of

4108
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:12,240
when you play fresh and you are ahead on

4109
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:13,680
tempo, even if you don't actually hit

4110
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:15,840
the hooks, which so far has been a bit

4111
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:18,000
of a problem, just being on the map

4112
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:19,040
making moves, forcing people off turrets

4113
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,359
is already a big win.

4114
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:22,319
Yeah.

4115
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:24,000
So T1 able to use that nicely. Now we do

4116
02:45:22,319 --> 02:45:27,120
look to the other side and we see that

4117
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,319
Ruler is I think a little behind. I

4118
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:29,439
think really when you when you're

4119
02:45:28,319 --> 02:45:31,520
feeling really good in the center,

4120
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:33,680
you're going to hit 60 souls at about 20

4121
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:36,720
minutes. I think the average in MSI was

4122
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:38,479
like 51 at 20. I think he's more on

4123
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:41,120
track for that. He's going a really

4124
02:45:38,479 --> 02:45:43,120
weird build though because I was I was

4125
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:44,720
talking to a and you're supposed to

4126
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:46,720
build essence first.

4127
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:47,520
No, no, no, no, no. Atlas, I know I I

4128
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:49,359
know you don't actually.

4129
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:50,800
He can still make up for it by building

4130
02:45:49,359 --> 02:45:52,720
runon second, right?

4131
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:54,560
I'm not ready to talk about DK. Okay, we

4132
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:56,560
can talk about Donkey Kong. No, I want

4133
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:58,960
to talk about D plus K. I wasn't I was

4134
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:00,560
off that day. That wasn't real.

4135
02:45:58,960 --> 02:46:01,200
Oh, it definitely was. I saw you in

4136
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:03,279
chat.

4137
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:05,600
Yeah, I remember cuz you said juke juke

4138
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:07,439
and that made me sad. was already a

4139
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:09,760
juke. Okay, that's all right. Carrier

4140
02:46:07,439 --> 02:46:11,920
with the flash play. On looking to go on

4141
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:13,840
in as well, but the Arcane Storm wants

4142
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:16,000
to take down the one more tick will do

4143
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:18,720
it, but it's not going to connect as now

4144
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:20,080
the cask will deliver Canyon to his

4145
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:22,720
death potential. He did have to

4146
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:25,200
subjugate there. And oh my god, Ona

4147
02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:27,120
survives the headbutt to get Kumushi out

4148
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:29,920
of here, but he is an absolute

4149
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:32,000
demolition machine. And Genji, they

4150
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:35,120
might be staring down the barrel of

4151
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:36,960
their first loss of the season.

4152
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:38,960
Keane trying to look for a counter pick.

4153
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:40,640
The hook hits in. He does manage to at

4154
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:41,840
least get carry. He's flashing in

4155
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:43,600
looking for even more. The turret's

4156
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:45,359
helping him out at the same time, but

4157
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:46,880
Ona is also going to be able to get a

4158
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:49,920
cute little charge. And that will help

4159
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:51,840
take down the croc. This guy's in. It is

4160
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:54,560
built different, ladies and gentlemen.

4161
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:56,560
And that whole time Kumushi was just

4162
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:58,720
slaughtering them. 303 now on the

4163
02:46:56,560 --> 02:47:00,640
Aalios. Yeah, we're going to need a few

4164
02:46:58,720 --> 02:47:03,439
hundred more years.

4165
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:05,279
There was Carrier surviving there. But

4166
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:09,359
for me, as you highlight, I want

4167
02:47:05,279 --> 02:47:11,520
everyone to look at Owner in this fight.

4168
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:13,279
Carrier starts it off, but the fight

4169
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:15,040
initially isn't actually that good.

4170
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:16,560
Carrie almost goes down. If that if he

4171
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:18,160
goes down and that becomes a big chaos

4172
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:20,880
storm could have been the arc in could

4173
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:24,240
have been different than that, but then

4174
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:26,160
here owner goes in with just the

4175
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:28,240
slightest bit of health. Takes down

4176
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:31,600
Ruler, which is the essential damage

4177
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:34,160
necessary. And then Doran

4178
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:36,479
being a frontliner that we have seen in

4179
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:37,120
him be for so many teams including Geng

4180
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:37,600
by the way.

4181
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:41,120
Oh yeah,

4182
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:44,240
got them two titles and then Keen here.

4183
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:46,479
This is really funny as uh Owner just

4184
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:49,600
with barely any health left gets the

4185
02:47:46,479 --> 02:47:53,200
point blank charge and tanks the turret

4186
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:55,760
and tanks a the turret shot afterwards

4187
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:57,840
as well. Yep. 4 and 1/2k gold lead now

4188
02:47:55,760 --> 02:47:59,120
and I think this drake or Genji are

4189
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:01,359
going to contest. I don't know if they

4190
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:04,000
really can. There's the hex flash hook

4191
02:48:01,359 --> 02:48:05,920
onto Duro. Not too much more to happen

4192
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:08,399
after that, but there's a glorious cast

4193
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:10,399
onto Chobi. Does get the gravity field

4194
02:48:08,399 --> 02:48:12,800
down as now Duro does get a pulverized,

4195
02:48:10,399 --> 02:48:14,880
but Faker is making his way in. And Ono

4196
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:16,960
just finding it. Ruler goes down yet

4197
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:19,200
again. The entire bottom lane has been

4198
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:20,560
removed and Faker will just take a bit

4199
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:22,000
of a journey underneath the turret.

4200
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:24,479
Might have been a bridge a little too

4201
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:26,880
far as Carrier looks for another cute

4202
02:48:24,479 --> 02:48:28,160
little play. needs a few extra links in

4203
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:29,600
that chain though if he wants to get

4204
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:31,600
that one. As owner going in one more

4205
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:34,160
time, it's the most balanced Trundle has

4206
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:35,840
looked all week as the hook this time.

4207
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:37,760
He's going to connect. It lands onto

4208
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:40,000
Chobi Kuma's going to grab that kill.

4209
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:42,160
And Carrier, I mean, I don't know how it

4210
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:44,240
worked, but it absolutely worked. He had

4211
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:46,319
some of the most crazy hooks ever, but

4212
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:49,120
he lands them when he needs to. And the

4213
02:48:46,319 --> 02:48:51,520
inner is going to then go down. T1, they

4214
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:53,920
are so far ahead. This is all just about

4215
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:57,279
knocking down these turrets and securing

4216
02:48:53,920 --> 02:49:00,960
the first victory against Gen for any

4217
02:48:57,279 --> 02:49:03,600
team since the LCK season started.

4218
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:07,040
Since February,

4219
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:09,040
we are free season. It was winter.

4220
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:13,520
Spring has come and gone. We're in the

4221
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:15,520
heat of summer and T1 at their home grab

4222
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:18,319
might actually be able to do what no

4223
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:21,200
team has done in so

4224
02:49:18,319 --> 02:49:22,240
so many months. Oh, that uh there's a

4225
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:23,279
ward right there, too. We're going to

4226
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:25,840
check this one out one more time.

4227
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:30,640
Starting with Carrier finding the little

4228
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:31,760
but Doran's just like these casks, man.

4229
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:33,279
It's working out. There's not enough

4230
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:35,040
damage available. And even with Carrier

4231
02:49:33,279 --> 02:49:37,359
hooking a minion, owner sees the space

4232
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:39,279
to go in. Ruler again doesn't get to

4233
02:49:37,359 --> 02:49:41,840
play the video game. And then here,

4234
02:49:39,279 --> 02:49:43,520
watch this lantern. Faker looks like he

4235
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:46,000
might go down. Keen even tries to get on

4236
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:49,600
top of him. Doesn't quite work. Denowner

4237
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:52,080
applies pressure to Canyon here. the T1

4238
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:54,160
these staggered approaches this

4239
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:56,560
continued pressure as there is the

4240
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:58,720
download onto Chi just in time.

4241
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,960
Yeah, he knew that one. Him and Chi,

4242
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:03,439
they go way back. So going to be able to

4243
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:06,800
lock him down. And now Genji staring

4244
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:11,040
down the barrel of 6,000 gold.

4245
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:12,160
That is Goomba sitting on a 3.2k gold

4246
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:14,319
lead.

4247
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:16,319
Two items on the Aalios

4248
02:50:14,319 --> 02:50:18,640
and Genji. Yeah, in theory this comp,

4249
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:19,920
they're part of it that scale well, but

4250
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:22,640
is going to be behind on souls not going

4251
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:25,120
to be able to really farm them up. Chovi

4252
02:50:22,640 --> 02:50:27,279
is again going for a build that is going

4253
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:28,800
to take a long time to you're talking

4254
02:50:27,279 --> 02:50:30,319
like fourth item at this point. Looks

4255
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:30,880
like he's going to go what Leandre

4256
02:50:30,319 --> 02:50:32,960
second.

4257
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:36,080
Yeah, I think this is going to be a next

4258
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:38,560
series uh Road of Ages before that's

4259
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:41,120
going to be very useful. And I have

4260
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:44,080
watched Genji uh I think this was the

4261
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:46,640
first test of five between them at MSI

4262
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:48,399
crawl back from a big deficit. Was a

4263
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:51,760
very different drop was a very different

4264
02:50:48,399 --> 02:50:54,160
setup. This T1 palm just the it skills

4265
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:55,760
well like the 5v5s will remain good.

4266
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:58,000
There are obviously parts of Genji that

4267
02:50:55,760 --> 02:51:00,080
are going to become a problem eventually

4268
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:02,720
like the range on Chovi the damage on

4269
02:51:00,080 --> 02:51:04,000
Ruler and his stacking but I don't think

4270
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:06,000
that we're really going to reach that

4271
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:08,240
point. And the problem is is like I'm

4272
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,240
looking at these junglers as well and I

4273
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:11,920
can count and that's making things look

4274
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:14,080
a little bit worrying here for Geng

4275
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:17,120
because there is shoes and then two

4276
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:20,160
items for owner and there is shoes and

4277
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:23,439
one triangular fan here for Canyon and

4278
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:25,439
it's not really looking great.

4279
02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:26,800
This is just a T1 that are well and

4280
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:28,479
truly powered up. We're talking about

4281
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:30,000
like item spikes that are just perfect

4282
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:32,880
for this stage of the game as well with

4283
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:35,120
this composition as a hook is just going

4284
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:36,560
to sail on by. Death going to come on

4285
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:38,800
through there as well as Chi will be

4286
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:39,920
able to at least sidestep the cask, but

4287
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:41,439
owner is looking to make his way in.

4288
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:44,080
Another hook is going to be fantastic

4289
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:46,640
here as Chi's already got that flash on.

4290
02:51:44,080 --> 02:51:49,760
In comes the moonlight vigil and down

4291
02:51:46,640 --> 02:51:52,000
goes Geng. There's at least a couple of

4292
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:53,520
kills back here as they do manage to

4293
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:55,439
trade with the help of the turret. But

4294
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:57,680
T1 are so far ahead. They don't really

4295
02:51:55,439 --> 02:51:58,960
mind that Doran and Carrier go down. The

4296
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:00,640
damage is still here.

4297
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:02,800
There's still a walking turret in the

4298
02:52:00,640 --> 02:52:03,359
form of GMA.

4299
02:52:02,800 --> 02:52:05,040
Doesn't get to play.

4300
02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:07,680
He's an upgraded turret.

4301
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:09,120
Yeah, cuz he also kills other turrets in

4302
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:10,640
a matter of seconds.

4303
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:12,640
Well, red, white, don't fight. Well,

4304
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:14,640
that is not what T1 are thinking.

4305
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:17,200
They've got a green gun now. So, the

4306
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:18,960
extra range here for Gumushi. Are we

4307
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:21,040
like looking at like a deep flank

4308
02:52:18,960 --> 02:52:21,600
bolstered by TP? No, he's just farming

4309
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,800
raptors.

4310
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:23,439
Yeah, we're looking at raptors. That's

4311
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:24,319
where we're looking.

4312
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:25,840
All right, he did get him.

4313
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:28,000
Yeah, he did manage to lock that one

4314
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:29,920
down. Nailed it. Didn't doesn't have

4315
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,439
subjugate, so does need to be a little

4316
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:32,560
careful.

4317
02:52:31,439 --> 02:52:34,720
Doesn't quite find the angle.

4318
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:37,120
Only saving grace for Geng is that soul

4319
02:52:34,720 --> 02:52:39,520
isn't that imminent. That's it. Uh maybe

4320
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:43,120
you can get to a third item as we take a

4321
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:44,960
look here for Troy. Nice movement. Nice

4322
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:46,479
side steps initially, but then still

4323
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:47,359
gets tagged and then that hook from

4324
02:52:46,479 --> 02:52:49,200
Carrier.

4325
02:52:47,359 --> 02:52:52,160
Black is out. Still gets hooked.

4326
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:54,000
Yeah, might not have the uh again uh the

4327
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:55,520
earlier hooks down, but these hooks on

4328
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,640
Trophy actually end up winning the

4329
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:59,279
fights cuz Trophy doesn't get more

4330
02:52:56,640 --> 02:53:00,560
rotations off and the flashes you

4331
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:01,680
highlight is a really big deal. The fact

4332
02:53:00,560 --> 02:53:04,880
he doesn't have that available means

4333
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:07,840
that both Doran, even Owner and Carrier

4334
02:53:04,880 --> 02:53:11,840
have way better angles. Ruler still not

4335
02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:13,120
at 60. By the way, Duro, I I swear he's

4336
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:15,680
trying, guys. Do not look at that

4337
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:16,640
combination of summoners. It's fine.

4338
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:17,120
Yeah.

4339
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:19,200
Oh,

4340
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:21,200
so Genji like I'm trying to think of

4341
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:24,000
angles for them to somehow bring us to a

4342
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:26,080
competitive game three. We need probably

4343
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,479
Canyon the steel or they let this one go

4344
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:30,560
and

4345
02:53:26,479 --> 02:53:32,880
well actually there are three rounds um

4346
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:35,279
at this particular end of the year as

4347
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:36,880
Ruler is just going to get engaged on.

4348
02:53:35,279 --> 02:53:39,439
Does have to flash and there's another

4349
02:53:36,880 --> 02:53:41,279
cast this time. No avoiding that. And

4350
02:53:39,439 --> 02:53:42,960
that is Faker grabbing a bunch of extra

4351
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:44,560
gold.

4352
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:46,640
Yep. Sometimes you ruler and you're a

4353
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:50,240
little bit too pushed up. This was the

4354
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:52,160
first pick center as well, guys. Really

4355
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:54,640
taking a bit of a face plant here on the

4356
02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:57,279
side of Genji. Kind of torn apart by

4357
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:58,720
T1's answer.

4358
02:53:57,279 --> 02:54:00,479
And going into this, I actually felt

4359
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:02,560
like Genji's composition looked good.

4360
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:04,399
It is. But the way that T1 have played

4361
02:54:02,560 --> 02:54:07,200
this, the way they moved Kumishi around

4362
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:10,640
the map and turned him into this

4363
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:12,399
slaughter machine has been just

4364
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:13,600
beautiful. He'll take the lantern ride

4365
02:54:12,399 --> 02:54:14,960
to get himself out of there. We also

4366
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:17,200
just haven't seen that much success for

4367
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:18,800
Thresh. Even when Carrier tried to play

4368
02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:21,600
it the last couple of times, it hasn't

4369
02:54:18,800 --> 02:54:23,120
really been all that inspiring. This is

4370
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:24,880
working out a bunch better even after a

4371
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:26,720
couple of flubs earlier on. And now

4372
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:28,560
you're also looking at a scenario where

4373
02:54:26,720 --> 02:54:30,399
how do you actually engage onto T1 if

4374
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:32,319
you're Geng because there is there is

4375
02:54:30,399 --> 02:54:36,720
Carrier who is a walking lantern bot has

4376
02:54:32,319 --> 02:54:39,359
fle as um

4377
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:40,240
Canyon Canyon is Canyon is dead. He

4378
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:43,520
might not be down. He

4379
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:45,600
does have a lot of speed.

4380
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:49,279
He is dead. Um

4381
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:51,120
so is this dragon he it'll it'll run.

4382
02:54:49,279 --> 02:54:54,160
It'll make him work for it. But

4383
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:56,640
yeah. Um well

4384
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:58,000
Malov gaming there as he does Doran just

4385
02:54:56,640 --> 02:55:00,640
going to boot himself away to try and

4386
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:02,560
avoid that again play before.

4387
02:55:00,640 --> 02:55:04,160
Oh it's the fake out and Faker then

4388
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:06,720
Faker out.

4389
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:08,880
That was okay I'm I'm

4390
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:10,800
that was weird. Um

4391
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:12,880
there was a there's a dead troll. The

4392
02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:15,600
dead troll dead dragon soul point now

4393
02:55:12,880 --> 02:55:17,359
for T1. Don't know whether that is all

4394
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:19,439
that relevant cuz the game could just be

4395
02:55:17,359 --> 02:55:22,399
over in 4 and 1/2 minutes. Yeah, it's

4396
02:55:19,439 --> 02:55:24,960
just a beautiful snowballing from T1,

4397
02:55:22,399 --> 02:55:26,319
right? It it and it really comes down to

4398
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:28,319
that one dive in top.

4399
02:55:26,319 --> 02:55:31,520
Oh dear. Ruler is just dead. Cut the

4400
02:55:28,319 --> 02:55:33,920
video. Cut the video. Cut the video.

4401
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:35,760
You need to watch it. It's a little bit

4402
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:37,279
worrying here as at least Keane does

4403
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:39,120
have a Dominus. Faker is going to take a

4404
02:55:37,279 --> 02:55:41,439
lantern ride to get out. Scot-free from

4405
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:43,439
that one. And Chi comes on over, but he

4406
02:55:41,439 --> 02:55:46,319
comes on over a whole lot later than he

4407
02:55:43,439 --> 02:55:47,680
needed to. And Arcane Storm is down

4408
02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:50,720
underneath this turret. He does go

4409
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:54,240
golden as that is a dead Gragas maybe.

4410
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:55,120
No, they are in fact too far ahead

4411
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:56,720
ladies and gentlemen.

4412
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:59,520
The wallets Atlas.

4413
02:55:56,720 --> 02:56:02,880
Yeah, that was the pianoized wallet

4414
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:05,200
right on the noggin of Chovi and T1 will

4415
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:08,399
be able to push these super minions in

4416
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:11,520
for the first time in a deciding game of

4417
02:56:08,399 --> 02:56:14,800
a series this season. Gen are looking to

4418
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:16,479
go down. We'll see. There is a pillar of

4419
02:56:14,800 --> 02:56:17,920
filth there just to delay it. I was

4420
02:56:16,479 --> 02:56:19,279
about to start the monologue, but I

4421
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:22,399
guess we'll have to hold off.

4422
02:56:19,279 --> 02:56:25,040
What? What? What hit ruler? Why is he

4423
02:56:22,399 --> 02:56:28,800
Did he get hit by like blue gun?

4424
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:32,319
Um I swear he just respawned

4425
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:34,080
and he was at like maybe uh rice bounds.

4426
02:56:32,319 --> 02:56:36,399
He is 0 five and zero.

4427
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:37,760
Oh yeah, he's also level I I I there's a

4428
02:56:36,399 --> 02:56:40,319
lot. I'm just wondering what

4429
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:42,720
specifically like looked at him. I think

4430
02:56:40,319 --> 02:56:45,760
someone may have breathed in his

4431
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:48,720
vicinity on the T1 side of things is uh

4432
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:52,880
I think what happened and his health bar

4433
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:55,439
vanished. We Why are we getting a replay

4434
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:57,760
as Ono was just he is just here. He was

4435
02:56:55,439 --> 02:57:00,000
just ready. You know what? Getting two

4436
02:56:57,760 --> 02:57:02,880
flashes that's war. I'm not even I'm not

4437
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:04,560
even

4438
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:08,160
um shouldn't have happened.

4439
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:11,040
Well, T1 are just going to deny this is

4440
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:11,760
Keen. Okay.

4441
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:13,920
Um

4442
02:57:11,760 --> 02:57:14,560
Atlas, this this whole situation.

4443
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:16,080
Yes.

4444
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:17,680
It just reminds me of when you were

4445
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:18,399
like, "Mal, I'm fine." And then you were

4446
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:20,399
not fine.

4447
02:57:18,399 --> 02:57:22,720
That's what I'm looking at right now.

4448
02:57:20,399 --> 02:57:24,880
It's the jetlike scenario. Yes. Uh well,

4449
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:27,920
the uh Victor is just going to get taken

4450
02:57:24,880 --> 02:57:30,160
down as T1 just catch two teleports that

4451
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:30,880
come in delivering members of Geng to

4452
02:57:30,160 --> 02:57:32,080
their doom.

4453
02:57:30,880 --> 02:57:33,439
They're doing it, Atlas.

4454
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:34,720
They are definitely doing it. They're

4455
02:57:33,439 --> 02:57:36,240
just going to wander down. Baron is

4456
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:39,279
unnecessary as Ruler is going to be

4457
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:41,760
discovered by Ona once again. This time

4458
02:57:39,279 --> 02:57:42,800
the snare comes in, but now he's just

4459
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:44,560
going to hunt him down to the ends of

4460
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:46,640
the earth. And that is maybe going to

4461
02:57:44,560 --> 02:57:51,920
Infinity in this game because T1 will

4462
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:55,200
end it and end Geng's streak. 27 is all

4463
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:58,160
they will get as T1 in their home

4464
02:57:55,200 --> 02:58:02,200
ground. Will be able to take down Geng

4465
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:02,200
for the first time this season.

4466
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:12,000
What a win here for T1.

4467
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:14,720
And it's vintage. It is 2022 again. We

4468
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:17,600
are watching Faker impact the sidelines

4469
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:19,760
and we are watching Aelios fresh. And

4470
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:22,080
and you know Carrier, you just to shake

4471
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:22,880
off the rust little early on as I got to

4472
02:58:22,080 --> 02:58:27,040
I got to vote for

4473
02:58:22,880 --> 02:58:29,439
you P. Uh

4474
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:32,399
I feel like this is just a I'm I'm I'm

4475
02:58:29,439 --> 02:58:33,279
I'm being met with skepticism. Uh

4476
02:58:32,399 --> 02:58:36,240
it's up to you.

4477
02:58:33,279 --> 02:58:37,120
Okay. Who Who do you got? Well,

4478
02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:39,680
oh, gotcha.

4479
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:41,520
No, I I I I just always think it's Doran

4480
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:43,439
when he plays Gragas.

4481
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:45,439
It's always Doran when he plays Gragas

4482
02:58:43,439 --> 02:58:47,840
to me. Although, uh I think there's

4483
02:58:45,439 --> 02:58:49,359
quite a few decent choices here.

4484
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:50,960
It might be It might be Kuma.

4485
02:58:49,359 --> 02:58:53,600
Yeah. The one thing to me that really

4486
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:55,840
stands out in my mind is that moment

4487
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:57,760
Jarvin was banned.

4488
02:58:55,840 --> 02:58:59,279
I think Genji lost the series.

4489
02:58:57,760 --> 02:59:00,560
Yeah, you're you're really you're you're

4490
02:58:59,279 --> 02:59:00,880
not on board with the Jarvin there. I

4491
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:02,800
think

4492
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:06,080
No, I think you ban Azia every single

4493
02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:08,800
time. You never give that pick away.

4494
02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:11,520
I think it's uh like Azir was buffed and

4495
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:14,080
he was perma banned against every LCK

4496
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:15,680
team prior to the buffs.

4497
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:17,600
Yeah, I just don't think it's I don't

4498
02:59:15,680 --> 02:59:22,240
think it's legal and I think that sort

4499
02:59:17,600 --> 02:59:24,479
of really threw Gen uh off immediately

4500
02:59:22,240 --> 02:59:27,600
afterwards. I'm just happy to see Jen or

4501
02:59:24,479 --> 02:59:29,520
T1 rather play classic T1 right as I'm

4502
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:31,279
sure the crowd went absolutely wild

4503
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:33,760
after that one

4504
02:59:31,279 --> 02:59:35,680
as the

4505
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:38,720
league that Genji has has highlighted

4506
02:59:35,680 --> 02:59:40,640
they are already qualified for worlds um

4507
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:43,439
is not something that is going to be

4508
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:46,399
taken down in a single victory but given

4509
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:49,359
how many close series these two have had

4510
02:59:46,399 --> 02:59:52,080
over the last couple of months I think

4511
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:54,960
it's very warranted as Doran got to love

4512
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:57,439
him the Gragas ends up paying huge

4513
02:59:54,960 --> 02:59:59,120
dividends again. And I I'm right there

4514
02:59:57,439 --> 03:00:01,840
with you. Uh when it comes to those

4515
02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:03,279
casks, man doesn't doesn't miss.

4516
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:05,840
Honestly, I think that he almost played

4517
03:00:03,279 --> 03:00:07,520
a perfect game uh in that last one. The

4518
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:09,439
interrupt on the teleport as well where

4519
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:11,439
he was casking midair and managed to

4520
03:00:09,439 --> 03:00:13,279
land the body slam as well, picking all

4521
03:00:11,439 --> 03:00:14,960
of the angles that Keen could be. Of

4522
03:00:13,279 --> 03:00:16,880
course, if he had have missed, he would

4523
03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:18,800
have looked ridiculous because he would

4524
03:00:16,880 --> 03:00:20,479
then have zero CC and just have to watch

4525
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:22,640
him teleport away. But still, he nailed

4526
03:00:20,479 --> 03:00:25,840
it. knew exactly where he was going to

4527
03:00:22,640 --> 03:00:27,680
be, what the options were, and executed

4528
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:30,800
on that play. And that really was what

4529
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:32,800
started that snowball rolling. And Genji

4530
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:33,279
never found their way back into the

4531
03:00:32,800 --> 03:00:35,520
game.

4532
03:00:33,279 --> 03:00:37,920
It was also uh actually a pretty good

4533
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:40,319
rise game from Faker cuz I think that in

4534
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:41,760
game number two, it was to me a lot more

4535
03:00:40,319 --> 03:00:44,000
about the draft and just the team as a

4536
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:45,760
whole. But I think in this game three,

4537
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:48,399
he was the one that actually set up

4538
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:50,240
multiple of these dives. uh him and

4539
03:00:48,399 --> 03:00:52,240
owner I think for me were really what

4540
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:53,840
kind of started the snowball and it's as

4541
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:56,640
you highlighted T1 have been able to

4542
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:59,120
play around that specific setup be it a

4543
03:00:56,640 --> 03:01:02,080
felios with white guns be it Jinx be a

4544
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:04,000
Caitlin about a million times this is a

4545
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:06,080
moment that I'm sure Jenji is going to

4546
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:08,319
review an infinite amount of times

4547
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:10,080
because that is where the game became

4548
03:01:08,319 --> 03:01:12,240
hard and this is probably where the game

4549
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:14,160
was lost. Yep, this was kind of over at

4550
03:01:12,240 --> 03:01:16,319
this point as carrier even managing to

4551
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:17,920
survive with his little lantern shield

4552
03:01:16,319 --> 03:01:22,080
towards the end there. But that cask,

4553
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:23,600
man. Oh, give my boy the pom.

4554
03:01:22,080 --> 03:01:25,279
I re I actually don't know who it's

4555
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:27,120
going to be. Like I I'm I'm trying to

4556
03:01:25,279 --> 03:01:29,600
cuz I could see an argument for

4557
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:30,960
I think Sups and Chisik are going to go

4558
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:34,800
with GMA.

4559
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:36,720
Okay. And I think that the true sants

4560
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:39,439
like Jonas Strong for example will go

4561
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:41,279
for Doran. And I think the people that

4562
03:01:39,439 --> 03:01:43,520
only half watch will probably go for

4563
03:01:41,279 --> 03:01:45,680
owner because he's always a good vote.

4564
03:01:43,520 --> 03:01:46,800
And uh and the rest will go for carrier

4565
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:49,840
because it's hilarious.

4566
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:51,200
Cuz you you just call me out like that.

4567
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:53,040
Wait, who did you vote for?

4568
03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:54,960
Oh, you know who I voted for.

4569
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:56,880
I have no idea.

4570
03:01:54,960 --> 03:01:58,399
Everyone everyone

4571
03:01:56,880 --> 03:02:00,800
and actually like the majority of the

4572
03:01:58,399 --> 03:02:04,000
votes are going to go for

4573
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:06,399
cuz his uh fourman uh was pretty nice on

4574
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:09,120
the Azir. My recency bias is coming in

4575
03:02:06,399 --> 03:02:11,680
with my uh I think Doran should get it,

4576
03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:14,399
but also it's just you. It's Doran, man.

4577
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:16,319
He's just so lovable. I know. And he's

4578
03:02:14,399 --> 03:02:17,600
and he's Gragas, man. It's always so

4579
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:19,520
good.

4580
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:21,359
And every time he plays Gragas, I always

4581
03:02:19,520 --> 03:02:23,200
want justice for Doran missing out on

4582
03:02:21,359 --> 03:02:23,920
MVP when Pace got it that time and he

4583
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:25,920
didn't deserve it.

4584
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:27,279
Okay, well, let's let's not open back.

4585
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:29,359
My favorite part is look at the little

4586
03:02:27,279 --> 03:02:31,680
mascot in the player camps. That's just

4587
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:35,760
like as the crowd is going wild, the

4588
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:36,880
mass, yeah, we're doing it. Look at it.

4589
03:02:35,760 --> 03:02:38,319
It's adorable.

4590
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:40,000
It's very cute. And we also get it

4591
03:02:38,319 --> 03:02:41,040
behind Faker and Goomer as well. Like we

4592
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,399
get double mascots.

4593
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:42,880
You can even see a little bit there in

4594
03:02:42,399 --> 03:02:44,770
owner.

4595
03:02:42,880 --> 03:02:46,560
Yeah, that's true.

4596
03:02:44,770 --> 03:02:48,640
[Music]

4597
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:50,160
Given the side eye as Duro does manage

4598
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:50,880
to get a little bit of revenge towards

4599
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:53,600
the end here.

4600
03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:56,560
How poetic that it's T1 that ends it

4601
03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:58,560
after Genji denied them both the upper

4602
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:59,600
bracket finals as well as the finals of

4603
03:02:58,560 --> 03:03:01,359
MSI.

4604
03:02:59,600 --> 03:03:02,560
Yeah. And I don't know how Genji are

4605
03:03:01,359 --> 03:03:06,120
ever going to recover. Are they even

4606
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:06,120
going to make it to Worlds?

4607
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:12,399
The answer is yes, everyone, because

4608
03:03:09,680 --> 03:03:12,880
they qualified two days ago. That's the

4609
03:03:12,399 --> 03:03:16,399
joke.

4610
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:18,880
Atlas, I really need to rebuild my uh my

4611
03:03:16,399 --> 03:03:20,399
Atlas palace. I I I I'm not

4612
03:03:18,880 --> 03:03:22,160
You did like that was all that was

4613
03:03:20,399 --> 03:03:23,680
building for the story that we had to

4614
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:28,399
get to and you just left me hanging.

4615
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:30,399
It's Carrier that picks it up. Okay,

4616
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:32,479
that's a that I mean that's a that's an

4617
03:03:30,399 --> 03:03:35,680
option.

4618
03:03:32,479 --> 03:03:38,399
He was on the team. I do starting the

4619
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:40,640
second half. Uh his his fresh was really

4620
03:03:38,399 --> 03:03:42,080
good. Uh and I think the the Ra

4621
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:45,040
performance was solid as highlight. I

4622
03:03:42,080 --> 03:03:48,000
think him on uh him, Guma and Keria or

4623
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:50,399
him him and Gmba on Zia Rakan are always

4624
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:51,680
really good. Uh that's not I really

4625
03:03:50,399 --> 03:03:53,439
thought in hindsight that was going to

4626
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:55,840
be either GMA or Faker.

4627
03:03:53,439 --> 03:03:56,319
Yeah. And I I thought like I thought

4628
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:57,920
this game

4629
03:03:56,319 --> 03:03:59,120
it's just legit. Every player gets

4630
03:03:57,920 --> 03:04:00,960
votes.

4631
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:03,040
I imagine it's probably going to be a

4632
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:04,560
little bit all over the place. Um the

4633
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:06,640
fact that it was carry that picks it up

4634
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:08,640
was very very funny because some of

4635
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:11,120
those hooks earlier on in the game were

4636
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:13,040
just very strange. But the bait in the

4637
03:04:11,120 --> 03:04:14,479
mid lane absolutely fantastic and did

4638
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:16,319
manage to like catch

4639
03:04:14,479 --> 03:04:16,720
up, you know, like the he was doing the

4640
03:04:16,319 --> 03:04:18,319
dance.

4641
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:20,240
Yeah, he did definitely make some sick

4642
03:04:18,319 --> 03:04:21,840
plays and the Rakan was pretty

4643
03:04:20,240 --> 03:04:23,760
game-winning in the prior game and maybe

4644
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:25,600
we're just too used to seeing it at this

4645
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:28,080
point in time to really give him enough

4646
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:29,439
credit for that situation. So, an

4647
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:32,479
absolutely fantastic performance here

4648
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:35,359
from T1 and crazy that the streak ends

4649
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:37,040
here of all places. I was a little bit

4650
03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:39,840
early on my prediction of the streak

4651
03:04:37,040 --> 03:04:42,560
ending. Um, and instead I am speed

4652
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:45,120
running to meet Don in the predictions

4653
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:46,399
as I went like zero for two day one.

4654
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:47,040
He got a big win though. He got the

4655
03:04:46,399 --> 03:04:49,040
bros.

4656
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:50,080
Yeah, he got the bros and he got the T1

4657
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:52,319
today.

4658
03:04:50,080 --> 03:04:54,720
So, it is a threes.

4659
03:04:52,319 --> 03:04:56,640
It's a good w good week for Dion. Yeah,

4660
03:04:54,720 --> 03:04:58,560
I actually think that maybe we're even.

4661
03:04:56,640 --> 03:05:00,640
Maybe we're even at this point in time.

4662
03:04:58,560 --> 03:05:02,880
I don't I don't care. It's predictions.

4663
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:04,160
And I'm often like I'm a middle of the

4664
03:05:02,880 --> 03:05:06,319
pack kind of guy

4665
03:05:04,160 --> 03:05:07,680
and so as long as I can get up off the

4666
03:05:06,319 --> 03:05:08,720
As long as you don't want to you just

4667
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:11,120
don't want to get comic science.

4668
03:05:08,720 --> 03:05:14,479
Yeah, I took some risks this week and uh

4669
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:16,000
did not pay off and sometimes that's

4670
03:05:14,479 --> 03:05:20,200
fine. It is now time for us to head over

4671
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:20,200
to the interview though. Take it away.

4672
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:31,200
Thank you very much guys. This is dear

4673
03:05:29,439 --> 03:05:36,160
for the POM interview translation for

4674
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:38,160
the 2025 LCK road show at T1 home

4675
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:41,040
ground.

4676
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:45,279
We are joined by Kia on the side of T1

4677
03:05:41,040 --> 03:05:47,680
who just shut down Genji's 27 series

4678
03:05:45,279 --> 03:05:50,680
winning streak.

4679
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:50,680
Congratulations.

4680
03:05:52,479 --> 03:05:58,840
The genius monster has received the POM

4681
03:05:55,840 --> 03:05:58,840
today.

4682
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:05,439
You took such a valuable and incredible

4683
03:06:02,319 --> 03:06:08,240
victory at the LCK road show. We can

4684
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:11,040
feel all the energy from your fans. How

4685
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:14,000
does it feel to defeat the previously

4686
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:16,000
undefeated Jen Gi?

4687
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:20,080
You know, we were playing in front of

4688
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:22,399
all the fans that were supporting us

4689
03:06:20,080 --> 03:06:24,960
and I feel like

4690
03:06:22,399 --> 03:06:26,640
us winning must have made our fans

4691
03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:28,479
really happy. So, I'm just really glad

4692
03:06:26,640 --> 03:06:32,800
that we're able to live up to their

4693
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:37,120
expectations and pay back their support.

4694
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:39,040
Today was a rematch of the MSI finals.

4695
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:40,960
And because of how close the MSI matches

4696
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:43,840
were, you must have taken extra measures

4697
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:46,319
to prepare for today, you know, because

4698
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:48,800
the patch had not changed much since

4699
03:06:46,319 --> 03:06:52,160
MSI. I think we really just focused on

4700
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:55,040
what we had been preparing for and we

4701
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:57,600
tried to fix all the areas that we had

4702
03:06:55,040 --> 03:07:00,000
to work on, all the reasons that we lost

4703
03:06:57,600 --> 03:07:03,279
from the times that we were facing Jenji

4704
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:04,880
in the finals or in the MSI.

4705
03:07:03,279 --> 03:07:07,680
So, what kind of feedback was there

4706
03:07:04,880 --> 03:07:09,200
after game one?

4707
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:10,960
You know, even in game one, we were

4708
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:13,040
actually doing pretty well. And due to

4709
03:07:10,960 --> 03:07:16,080
our own mistakes, it actually went down

4710
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:18,240
that way, but we knew that the biggest

4711
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:20,640
area of improvement was really on

4712
03:07:18,240 --> 03:07:22,880
ourselves and our place. And we tried to

4713
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:24,399
make that and fix that as soon as we

4714
03:07:22,880 --> 03:07:27,120
can.

4715
03:07:24,399 --> 03:07:28,560
And in game two, the enemy left Azir

4716
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:30,319
open and it felt like they were steering

4717
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:34,439
you into picking him. So, what was the

4718
03:07:30,319 --> 03:07:34,439
discussion like during the draft?

4719
03:07:35,439 --> 03:07:40,399
I think we were actually just trying to

4720
03:07:37,840 --> 03:07:42,479
go ahead and ban some of the champions

4721
03:07:40,399 --> 03:07:44,080
that they were uh pretty good at and I

4722
03:07:42,479 --> 03:07:46,000
think that's why they ended up leaving

4723
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:49,600
the open and that's why we ended up

4724
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:52,800
having to pick him in the end

4725
03:07:49,600 --> 03:07:54,800
and so we saw your affiliates thresh

4726
03:07:52,800 --> 03:07:56,560
what made you pick him you know this was

4727
03:07:54,800 --> 03:07:58,479
something that we were thinking of even

4728
03:07:56,560 --> 03:08:02,240
back in MSI and we just didn't have a

4729
03:07:58,479 --> 03:08:04,800
chance to lock them in and today we just

4730
03:08:02,240 --> 03:08:06,560
saw an angle that we just could not

4731
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:08,720
pass.

4732
03:08:06,560 --> 03:08:10,399
And I feel like we were able to really

4733
03:08:08,720 --> 03:08:12,479
play it out the way we planned

4734
03:08:10,399 --> 03:08:14,720
everything. So, I'm just really glad

4735
03:08:12,479 --> 03:08:16,800
that we're able to execute everything so

4736
03:08:14,720 --> 03:08:19,680
well

4737
03:08:16,800 --> 03:08:22,160
and yeah, you got such a great early

4738
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:24,720
momentum

4739
03:08:22,160 --> 03:08:28,000
and you shut down the enemy's scaling.

4740
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:31,760
So, creating such a big gap, did you

4741
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:33,600
expect to win with your game plan?

4742
03:08:31,760 --> 03:08:35,520
you know, with the Falas, I felt like

4743
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:37,279
we're either going to win big or lose

4744
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:39,040
big,

4745
03:08:37,279 --> 03:08:41,600
but I'm just really happy that it played

4746
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:44,560
out our way.

4747
03:08:41,600 --> 03:08:48,000
[Music]

4748
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:50,319
And today's victory

4749
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:53,200
might just be thanks to all the fans

4750
03:08:50,319 --> 03:08:55,359
cheering from every direction on the

4751
03:08:53,200 --> 03:08:57,279
stage.

4752
03:08:55,359 --> 03:08:59,439
Wow, they are just deafening. So any

4753
03:08:57,279 --> 03:09:02,319
word for the fans who came all the way

4754
03:08:59,439 --> 03:09:05,040
to Yangjong do to support you know ever

4755
03:09:02,319 --> 03:09:07,279
since EWC I think we weren't feeling

4756
03:09:05,040 --> 03:09:09,600
very great not the best condition and I

4757
03:09:07,279 --> 03:09:12,399
think I'm uh few of us are suffering

4758
03:09:09,600 --> 03:09:16,000
from a cold but because of all the

4759
03:09:12,399 --> 03:09:17,760
energy that our fans sent us I think we

4760
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:19,920
even forgot that we weren't feeling well

4761
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:22,880
and I was able to focus on the game so

4762
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:25,920
thank you

4763
03:09:22,880 --> 03:09:26,880
and two days from now you will play nong

4764
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:28,960
redforce

4765
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:31,760
right where you are

4766
03:09:28,960 --> 03:09:33,439
any mindset going into that match

4767
03:09:31,760 --> 03:09:35,200
because of all the fans that will

4768
03:09:33,439 --> 03:09:38,920
attend. You know, I'm just going to have

4769
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:38,920
to make sure that we win

4770
03:09:40,800 --> 03:09:47,680
and this is the start of your round

4771
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:49,760
three. So, what are your goals?

4772
03:09:47,680 --> 03:09:53,600
You know, we really wanted to take it

4773
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:55,680
home for either MSI or EWC and we were

4774
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:58,240
unsuccessful. So, I want to make sure

4775
03:09:55,680 --> 03:10:01,240
that we win it all in the LCK this time

4776
03:09:58,240 --> 03:10:01,240
around.

4777
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:08,399
And please give it up for T1 and Kia.

4778
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:13,479
And that's the end of the interview with

4779
03:10:08,399 --> 03:10:13,479
Keria. Back to the space. Thank you.

4780
03:10:14,510 --> 03:10:18,399
[Music]

4781
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:20,800
Thank you, dear, as always, for that

4782
03:10:18,399 --> 03:10:23,760
awesome translation. Great to hear from

4783
03:10:20,800 --> 03:10:26,160
Kia in front of that gigantic crowd at

4784
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:28,080
the Inspire Arena. Great stuff from him.

4785
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:30,399
And uh yeah, T1 actually did it. They

4786
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:32,560
broke the streak. Crazy stuff. And

4787
03:10:30,399 --> 03:10:35,760
Jinzy, their streak will end there,

4788
03:10:32,560 --> 03:10:37,600
unfortunately for them at 27. Not going

4789
03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:40,160
to catch up to their previous streak of

4790
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:42,240
29, which was last year. Thoughts on

4791
03:10:40,160 --> 03:10:44,399
this, guys? I mean, it had to happen

4792
03:10:42,240 --> 03:10:45,920
eventually, right? Jen D's drafts were

4793
03:10:44,399 --> 03:10:47,760
really greedy in this series. And while

4794
03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:49,840
they often weren't punished in the past,

4795
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:51,760
they get punished by T1 here, especially

4796
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:53,520
in game two. I think that was the bigger

4797
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:55,600
uh discrepancy we had in draft than what

4798
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:57,359
happened in game three. Uh where

4799
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:58,880
ultimately it was a really cool Aelio's

4800
03:10:57,359 --> 03:10:59,760
Thresh angle. We'll talk a little bit

4801
03:10:58,880 --> 03:11:02,000
more about later.

4802
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:04,319
Yeah, I mean it was really brave idea to

4803
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:07,680
pick Thresh in game three. I mean, they

4804
03:11:04,319 --> 03:11:10,319
just lost in MSI finals at game five. uh

4805
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:12,720
Duro just picked a pike randomly against

4806
03:11:10,319 --> 03:11:14,960
uh Kerat, but this time around Kerat did

4807
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:17,520
some kind of revenge against that. And I

4808
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:20,160
think this kind of draft idea is always

4809
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:22,240
bringing up uh such a great opportunity

4810
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:24,240
in BO3 or BO5.

4811
03:11:22,240 --> 03:11:25,920
Yeah, absolutely. And uh you might think

4812
03:11:24,240 --> 03:11:27,520
that hey, Genji were the big favorites

4813
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:30,160
today. Obviously, everybody would have

4814
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:33,760
predicted them, right? Wrong. Actually,

4815
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:37,520
one person did go ahead and predict T1

4816
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:38,560
and that one person was Deon. Um gangly.

4817
03:11:37,520 --> 03:11:40,880
How did he know?

4818
03:11:38,560 --> 03:11:42,800
Interestingly though, I noticed Don was

4819
03:11:40,880 --> 03:11:44,479
actually at the home ground. He was

4820
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:45,840
actually there and he was sitting on the

4821
03:11:44,479 --> 03:11:48,560
Genji side.

4822
03:11:45,840 --> 03:11:50,399
Yeah, what did he mean by that? Why does

4823
03:11:48,560 --> 03:11:52,399
he do this where he tells everyone he

4824
03:11:50,399 --> 03:11:54,960
wants Bro to win and then predicts

4825
03:11:52,399 --> 03:11:56,399
against them? Uh, Dgon, we're going to

4826
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:58,240
have to have a little chat uh when

4827
03:11:56,399 --> 03:12:01,279
you're back here in Soul tomorrow.

4828
03:11:58,240 --> 03:12:02,080
So, is he is he happy inspire Arena at

4829
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:03,840
the Genji side?

4830
03:12:02,080 --> 03:12:05,279
Yeah. I wonder how the Genji fans they

4831
03:12:03,840 --> 03:12:07,040
sing with right now feel when they see

4832
03:12:05,279 --> 03:12:10,000
this come up on the screen.

4833
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:11,439
Yeah, he's probably locking his cell

4834
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,560
phone screen real quick right now.

4835
03:12:11,439 --> 03:12:14,560
Always watching the stream. He's like,

4836
03:12:12,560 --> 03:12:14,960
"Whoa, no,

4837
03:12:14,560 --> 03:12:17,120
no, I didn't."

4838
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:19,520
He got the PR right, but at what cost?

4839
03:12:17,120 --> 03:12:21,600
You know, let's hope he gets home safe

4840
03:12:19,520 --> 03:12:23,439
tonight. Uh guys, we do have the POM as

4841
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:26,479
well. Let's take a look at the votes and

4842
03:12:23,439 --> 03:12:29,279
see where they did go as it was a 6 out

4843
03:12:26,479 --> 03:12:30,880
of 13. And uh as the casters were

4844
03:12:29,279 --> 03:12:32,640
talking about, very much kind of split

4845
03:12:30,880 --> 03:12:34,800
up all over the place here. Even some

4846
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:36,640
votes for mid, which is pretty

4847
03:12:34,800 --> 03:12:38,399
interesting. Um Figer did have a good

4848
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:40,319
Azir game. So I guess there's that.

4849
03:12:38,399 --> 03:12:41,840
I really like the Guma votes because he

4850
03:12:40,319 --> 03:12:44,479
was extremely consistent throughout the

4851
03:12:41,840 --> 03:12:46,080
series. But for me, the recon plays we

4852
03:12:44,479 --> 03:12:48,800
saw from Carrier really solidified their

4853
03:12:46,080 --> 03:12:50,479
win uh in game two. Also, some of what

4854
03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:52,479
Guma was able to follow up on. But the

4855
03:12:50,479 --> 03:12:54,399
Thresh, yes, he missed some hooks.

4856
03:12:52,479 --> 03:12:56,080
Doesn't matter. the the draft pick, the

4857
03:12:54,399 --> 03:12:58,080
mastery of Thresh that this guy has

4858
03:12:56,080 --> 03:13:00,000
allows them to draft this Aphelio setup

4859
03:12:58,080 --> 03:13:01,920
here and they played it so well into

4860
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:04,720
this melee setup here for the side of

4861
03:13:01,920 --> 03:13:06,080
Genji. The Thresh was so key. Yeah. And

4862
03:13:04,720 --> 03:13:08,479
especially when you think about the team

4863
03:13:06,080 --> 03:13:11,359
comp, you have to play against Pillar

4864
03:13:08,479 --> 03:13:13,520
and you have to somehow have like play

4865
03:13:11,359 --> 03:13:16,080
against Victor as well, which is like

4866
03:13:13,520 --> 03:13:18,319
outrange for Thresh, but he just flashed

4867
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:19,920
into Victor and somehow reached to

4868
03:13:18,319 --> 03:13:22,240
Victor. I think that was the main part

4869
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:24,560
of the this game on the mid turret that

4870
03:13:22,240 --> 03:13:27,279
carrier landed the engage and the both

4871
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:29,279
hook as well. I I think it's just really

4872
03:13:27,279 --> 03:13:31,439
brave enough to just pick a game three

4873
03:13:29,279 --> 03:13:33,439
fresh when thresh is not the main mana

4874
03:13:31,439 --> 03:13:36,160
pick in the support lane.

4875
03:13:33,439 --> 03:13:38,800
Yep. No game five pike this time. Never

4876
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:40,640
let this man have Shinjo ever again says

4877
03:13:38,800 --> 03:13:42,479
Chronicler. Um I feel like we've said

4878
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:43,840
that about Owner with a decent amount of

4879
03:13:42,479 --> 03:13:45,040
champs at this point. Shinjo was

4880
03:13:43,840 --> 03:13:46,479
definitely one of them. Vi was another

4881
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:48,160
one of them. In the very beginning of

4882
03:13:46,479 --> 03:13:49,600
the season, we were like, "How does he

4883
03:13:48,160 --> 03:13:51,439
keep getting it every time?" And they

4884
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:53,359
just kept giving it to him. And even

4885
03:13:51,439 --> 03:13:55,520
though it has fallen in priority

4886
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:57,520
slightly, it's still an S tier jungle

4887
03:13:55,520 --> 03:13:59,200
pick that he absolutely obliterated.

4888
03:13:57,520 --> 03:14:00,239
Genji with there in the mid game of this

4889
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:01,840
one.

4890
03:14:00,239 --> 03:14:03,200
I mean, I I feel like every game is just

4891
03:14:01,840 --> 03:14:04,800
different. You know, the meta changes

4892
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:07,600
every single time. And here comes

4893
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:10,000
Rakhan. And you all know what Rakhan has

4894
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:12,319
really bad win rate, but Carrier always

4895
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:13,359
makes it different. Kas Rakhan is

4896
03:14:12,319 --> 03:14:14,880
different level.

4897
03:14:13,359 --> 03:14:17,200
Yeah, it was really good. uh played

4898
03:14:14,880 --> 03:14:19,520
alongside of the

4899
03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:20,319
Here comes Zia says Prince. So I guess

4900
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:21,760
they kind of

4901
03:14:20,319 --> 03:14:22,640
they coordinated it all.

4902
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:24,960
Imagine that.

4903
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:26,319
All right. Just like Zia and Raond do.

4904
03:14:24,960 --> 03:14:28,479
Yeah, those guys were able to do it on

4905
03:14:26,319 --> 03:14:29,040
the desk. What? You guys didn't really

4906
03:14:28,479 --> 03:14:30,479
coordinate.

4907
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:31,920
We just talked about the trash.

4908
03:14:30,479 --> 03:14:33,680
Yeah, we we talk to each other. We

4909
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:34,000
already have that synergy built in.

4910
03:14:33,680 --> 03:14:36,239
All right.

4911
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:39,120
Putting a bell on the tiger's neck.

4912
03:14:36,239 --> 03:14:40,399
Check.

4913
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:41,760
Well, there you go. Is there some kind

4914
03:14:40,399 --> 03:14:43,439
of reference there that I'm

4915
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:44,640
If a cat has a bell, you know where it

4916
03:14:43,439 --> 03:14:45,040
is at all times, right?

4917
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:46,640
Yeah.

4918
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:49,439
Maybe referencing the vision game from

4919
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:50,160
No, no, no. Jenji's Jenji is the uh the

4920
03:14:49,439 --> 03:14:52,319
the tiger.

4921
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:53,760
The tiger, but like if you know if you

4922
03:14:52,319 --> 03:14:55,040
put a bell on a cat, they usually do it

4923
03:14:53,760 --> 03:14:56,800
so you know where the cat is at all

4924
03:14:55,040 --> 03:14:58,239
times. Maybe that was like a vision

4925
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:00,239
thing. So, this is what I was thinking.

4926
03:14:58,239 --> 03:15:02,160
It's a Korean saying it's like the

4927
03:15:00,239 --> 03:15:03,760
impossible

4928
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:05,840
has been done or something like that.

4929
03:15:03,760 --> 03:15:07,600
Like cuz putting a bell on a tiger's

4930
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:09,359
neck is like really difficult, I guess.

4931
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:10,720
Anyway, uh let's talk about the draft

4932
03:15:09,359 --> 03:15:13,040
cuz we really wanted to talk about the

4933
03:15:10,720 --> 03:15:14,800
draft. Uh the Aelios Thresh obviously a

4934
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:16,560
big uh difference maker in this one.

4935
03:15:14,800 --> 03:15:17,920
So, I was yelling at the TV for the

4936
03:15:16,560 --> 03:15:19,680
Thresh. A lot of people were thinking

4937
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:22,080
this Grogas was going to be in the

4938
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:24,319
support role. Aelios is so strong right

4939
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:25,680
now. I I really really think that

4940
03:15:24,319 --> 03:15:27,520
especially with the crit builds we have

4941
03:15:25,680 --> 03:15:29,520
right now um that we're going to see

4942
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:31,279
more Aelios. It's been hovered a lot. We

4943
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:32,800
saw it at W EWC hovered. I was like,

4944
03:15:31,279 --> 03:15:34,640
please play the Aelio. It's just so

4945
03:15:32,800 --> 03:15:36,399
good. But when your enemy doesn't have

4946
03:15:34,640 --> 03:15:37,920
really consistent engage, you've got the

4947
03:15:36,399 --> 03:15:40,479
pillar, maybe Renekton can close that

4948
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:42,000
gap. The Senna will outrange doesn't

4949
03:15:40,479 --> 03:15:43,279
necessarily matter cuz the Trundle and

4950
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:45,279
Renekton, if they don't get on top of

4951
03:15:43,279 --> 03:15:47,680
the Selius who has a Thresh to back him

4952
03:15:45,279 --> 03:15:49,040
up, you just don't kill him and then he

4953
03:15:47,680 --> 03:15:49,840
does way more damage than anyone on

4954
03:15:49,040 --> 03:15:51,439
Genji can do.

4955
03:15:49,840 --> 03:15:53,520
Yeah. I mean, this is the reason why I

4956
03:15:51,439 --> 03:15:55,359
really hate the Senna Alysa together cuz

4957
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:58,640
I feel like you have no pressure in lane

4958
03:15:55,359 --> 03:16:01,760
at all. So normally Senna uh I think

4959
03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:03,600
they set up with the notless or time Ken

4960
03:16:01,760 --> 03:16:06,080
so you can have better lane but I feel

4961
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:08,319
like with Alissa you can do nothing much

4962
03:16:06,080 --> 03:16:10,239
on the lane. So and I think I think

4963
03:16:08,319 --> 03:16:12,160
getting a lane priority on the bot lane

4964
03:16:10,239 --> 03:16:13,600
it's just so much important in this meta

4965
03:16:12,160 --> 03:16:16,080
and I think that happened on the top

4966
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:18,000
side dive as well. So it was still

4967
03:16:16,080 --> 03:16:20,160
really brave enough to pick Aelius and

4968
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:22,399
Thresh cuz it's not in the meta and I

4969
03:16:20,160 --> 03:16:24,560
think uh it was just a game-winning

4970
03:16:22,399 --> 03:16:25,920
draft on the game three by T1.

4971
03:16:24,560 --> 03:16:27,600
Yeah, absolutely. It's not every day

4972
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:29,040
where we say, "Hey, the draft had a huge

4973
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:31,040
impact on this game." But it really does

4974
03:16:29,040 --> 03:16:32,960
feel like in this one it absolutely did.

4975
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:34,560
So that's a good shout there. Uh guys,

4976
03:16:32,960 --> 03:16:37,200
wanted to clear something up as well.

4977
03:16:34,560 --> 03:16:39,200
Earlier we uh aired a Annie stat that

4978
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:41,120
was actually incorrect. Uh this is the

4979
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:44,000
correct stat here. It's actually 3 and

4980
03:16:41,120 --> 03:16:46,399
one now after the Faker loss earlier.

4981
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:48,640
Similar idea. We had five and zero. It

4982
03:16:46,399 --> 03:16:49,040
was actually three and zero. Annie still

4983
03:16:48,640 --> 03:16:50,960
same.

4984
03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:52,239
Still the first loss of the uh the

4985
03:16:50,960 --> 03:16:53,920
season here or the round.

4986
03:16:52,239 --> 03:16:56,160
It doesn't matter. They broke the

4987
03:16:53,920 --> 03:16:58,640
record. So ultimately like the still the

4988
03:16:56,160 --> 03:17:00,479
still the same concept does uh apply

4989
03:16:58,640 --> 03:17:02,399
there. So just a correction. We're not

4990
03:17:00,479 --> 03:17:04,000
trying to bring up um the old wound of

4991
03:17:02,399 --> 03:17:05,120
game one again. They still won the

4992
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:07,439
series after all. Let's take a look at

4993
03:17:05,120 --> 03:17:11,120
the standings here as guess what guys,

4994
03:17:07,439 --> 03:17:13,439
Genji, they actually can bleed and T1 is

4995
03:17:11,120 --> 03:17:14,960
the team to do it. This kind of makes

4996
03:17:13,439 --> 03:17:16,000
sense when you think about it, but we

4997
03:17:14,960 --> 03:17:17,920
were all thinking that it's just going

4998
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:20,560
to be random like Nin is just going to

4999
03:17:17,920 --> 03:17:22,720
like take a win over them at some point.

5000
03:17:20,560 --> 03:17:24,479
At this point, T1's form is way better

5001
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:26,239
than Han life esports. So the fact that

5002
03:17:24,479 --> 03:17:27,600
T1's able to get this really incredible

5003
03:17:26,239 --> 03:17:29,600
win over Genji cuz you get the triple

5004
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:31,439
round robin in this group you can get

5005
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:33,120
two more opportunities to beat Genji but

5006
03:17:31,439 --> 03:17:35,200
your more realistic wins are like KT

5007
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:37,520
Nongim maybe Hanife Esports currently

5008
03:17:35,200 --> 03:17:40,080
though really big for T1 they absolutely

5009
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:42,720
can take that second place spot away and

5010
03:17:40,080 --> 03:17:44,160
I think it's kind of bad news for Genji

5011
03:17:42,720 --> 03:17:46,399
because like everyone was kind of

5012
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:48,160
confused why they open at zero and why

5013
03:17:46,399 --> 03:17:50,160
they're playing this team comp against

5014
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:52,960
T1. So I feel like they have to find

5015
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:55,359
some way about the dre but well on T1

5016
03:17:52,960 --> 03:17:56,960
side it's such a good news that you kind

5017
03:17:55,359 --> 03:18:00,000
of have a little revenge against the

5018
03:17:56,960 --> 03:18:03,600
Genji and I think this what matters when

5019
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:05,600
it comes to LCK final uh uh playoffs cuz

5020
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:09,279
the record like keeps going on and I

5021
03:18:05,600 --> 03:18:11,040
think T1 finally found find their way to

5022
03:18:09,279 --> 03:18:11,520
build around their synergy between the

5023
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:13,200
players.

5024
03:18:11,520 --> 03:18:15,279
Yeah, the form is great of T1. The

5025
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:16,880
drafting was great here. Uh it feels

5026
03:18:15,279 --> 03:18:19,040
like in all three games T1 had a better

5027
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:20,479
read than Genji did. So absolutely big

5028
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:23,200
deserved win and that's the way it does

5029
03:18:20,479 --> 03:18:26,399
go sometimes. Guys, we got the next

5030
03:18:23,200 --> 03:18:28,960
matchup. It is the Bros up against TRX.

5031
03:18:26,399 --> 03:18:30,880
The Rise group coming up next. You

5032
03:18:28,960 --> 03:18:33,760
thought T1 versus Genji was good? Just

5033
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:36,640
wait and see until bro faces off against

5034
03:18:33,760 --> 03:18:38,900
TRX. Banger alert here at the LCK. Stay

5035

Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to

5138
03:31:02,160 --> 03:31:06,319
LCK 2025. I'm Atlas, joined by

5139
03:31:04,720 --> 03:31:08,960
Chronicle, and we're ready to get into

5140
03:31:06,319 --> 03:31:11,840
the main event for today. It was really

5141
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:14,960
great seeing Geng and T1 warming

5142
03:31:11,840 --> 03:31:18,800
everyone up as the what are they the

5143
03:31:14,960 --> 03:31:20,800
support act for DRX bro that are about

5144
03:31:18,800 --> 03:31:22,960
that's about to happen now. I have no

5145
03:31:20,800 --> 03:31:25,200
idea what to expect. All I know is we're

5146
03:31:22,960 --> 03:31:26,800
going to learn things

5147
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:29,680
and we're going to be entertained.

5148
03:31:26,800 --> 03:31:32,399
That's all I know. And that's every

5149
03:31:29,680 --> 03:31:34,720
great thing that you watch has both of

5150
03:31:32,399 --> 03:31:37,200
those things.

5151
03:31:34,720 --> 03:31:40,800
I really do think that there is so much

5152
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:43,920
value in appreciating all facets of

5153
03:31:40,800 --> 03:31:46,800
anything. And when it comes to the LCK,

5154
03:31:43,920 --> 03:31:50,319
you can't call yourself a real LCK fan

5155
03:31:46,800 --> 03:31:54,399
if all you watch is T1 Geng. I'm sorry.

5156
03:31:50,319 --> 03:31:56,239
You have to earn it by enjoying with us.

5157
03:31:54,399 --> 03:31:59,040
A nice free gamer between DRS.

5158
03:31:56,239 --> 03:32:01,840
How did How did you make enjoying sound

5159
03:31:59,040 --> 03:32:04,319
so much like enduring? How did you do

5160
03:32:01,840 --> 03:32:06,080
that? That was very, very, very clever

5161
03:32:04,319 --> 03:32:08,080
of you, Chronicler, because you

5162
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:10,720
definitely said enjoying, but that's not

5163
03:32:08,080 --> 03:32:12,880
the word that I heard as there is a

5164
03:32:10,720 --> 03:32:14,800
closet bro antie in there somewhere.

5165
03:32:12,880 --> 03:32:16,399
I did predict them. I did predict him

5166
03:32:14,800 --> 03:32:18,000
here today.

5167
03:32:16,399 --> 03:32:19,920
Well, I mean, there'd be a reason for

5168
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:22,239
that, and that is because DRX are our

5169
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:24,880
second least winning team that we have

5170
03:32:22,239 --> 03:32:26,640
here in the LCK. Somehow DNF managed to

5171
03:32:24,880 --> 03:32:29,120
win two games, but it still says they're

5172
03:32:26,640 --> 03:32:32,720
on a seven loss streak um after their

5173
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:35,600
performance uh yesterday. And Bro, fresh

5174
03:32:32,720 --> 03:32:37,920
off a win up against DK, a team here in

5175
03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:39,520
the LCK. They did lose the tiebreaker,

5176
03:32:37,920 --> 03:32:41,760
but that wasn't actually included in

5177
03:32:39,520 --> 03:32:43,920
their streak. So technically, Bro

5178
03:32:41,760 --> 03:32:46,560
managed to break that streak and now are

5179
03:32:43,920 --> 03:32:48,800
looking to make it a perfect week. They

5180
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:50,319
can pick up a victory against DRX here.

5181
03:32:48,800 --> 03:32:52,560
Let's have a look. DRX though on a

5182
03:32:50,319 --> 03:32:55,840
fivematch winning streak against the

5183
03:32:52,560 --> 03:32:58,640
Bros. When have these sorts of records

5184
03:32:55,840 --> 03:33:00,479
ever really meant anything when it comes

5185
03:32:58,640 --> 03:33:03,359
to the Bros though? That's my question.

5186
03:33:00,479 --> 03:33:05,520
Wow. Uh Atlas just breaking the fourth

5187
03:33:03,359 --> 03:33:08,319
wall there. I I don't think it matters.

5188
03:33:05,520 --> 03:33:10,399
I am the conviction that today's going

5189
03:33:08,319 --> 03:33:12,000
to be a free gamer. I think it'll be

5190
03:33:10,399 --> 03:33:14,960
very close because even though bro

5191
03:33:12,000 --> 03:33:17,200
looked as good as they did, my boy

5192
03:33:14,960 --> 03:33:19,279
Crocco popped off closer showing that

5193
03:33:17,200 --> 03:33:22,080
he's really having a great year thus

5194
03:33:19,279 --> 03:33:23,680
far. I I just don't know what it means

5195
03:33:22,080 --> 03:33:25,040
cuz Bro could do that and then

5196
03:33:23,680 --> 03:33:26,880
immediately go back to not doing

5197
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:29,279
anything and getting blown up by this

5198
03:33:26,880 --> 03:33:31,840
man Teddy in the starting lineup after

5199
03:33:29,279 --> 03:33:34,000
90 days which uh with his victory being

5200
03:33:31,840 --> 03:33:35,680
a lot longer ago.

5201
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:36,720
Not that much longer ago actually. It's

5202
03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:38,319
like 24 days.

5203
03:33:36,720 --> 03:33:39,279
Yeah, that's that's that's that's a lot.

5204
03:33:38,319 --> 03:33:41,439
That's a month.

5205
03:33:39,279 --> 03:33:42,479
Yeah, I guess but I mean 90 days is

5206
03:33:41,439 --> 03:33:43,120
longer than that.

5207
03:33:42,479 --> 03:33:45,359
That's true.

5208
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:46,880
You know, I'd say in like you know it

5209
03:33:45,359 --> 03:33:48,080
just doesn't seem that long. Anyway,

5210
03:33:46,880 --> 03:33:50,000
both teams going to make their way out

5211
03:33:48,080 --> 03:33:53,439
into L Park here as we are back here

5212
03:33:50,000 --> 03:33:55,359
now. We were um previously in Inchan and

5213
03:33:53,439 --> 03:33:56,960
we have now made our way back to L Park

5214
03:33:55,359 --> 03:33:58,399
and I guess everyone did know that we

5215
03:33:56,960 --> 03:34:00,560
were already here waiting. But

5216
03:33:58,399 --> 03:34:02,880
thankfully we have now got people in the

5217
03:34:00,560 --> 03:34:05,520
crowd here at L Park. So it's not that

5218
03:34:02,880 --> 03:34:07,120
weird echoey yelling around and stuff

5219
03:34:05,520 --> 03:34:09,840
like that while everyone's having fun

5220
03:34:07,120 --> 03:34:12,479
elsewhere including Don who skipped out

5221
03:34:09,840 --> 03:34:14,160
on a bro match to head down to a home

5222
03:34:12,479 --> 03:34:15,439
home ground match for for T1

5223
03:34:14,160 --> 03:34:18,080
chronically. How do you feel about that?

5224
03:34:15,439 --> 03:34:20,160
I'm honest. I'm a known bro antie, you

5225
03:34:18,080 --> 03:34:22,479
know, and and and that's okay. Although

5226
03:34:20,160 --> 03:34:23,439
like the opposite bro antie though, we

5227
03:34:22,479 --> 03:34:26,000
don't really like that.

5228
03:34:23,439 --> 03:34:27,520
Well, let's be real. I ever since Crocco

5229
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:29,600
joined, I have been having a bit of a

5230
03:34:27,520 --> 03:34:30,000
crisis of big battles cuz I love that

5231
03:34:29,600 --> 03:34:31,760
man.

5232
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:32,800
You are the leader of the Crocco fan

5233
03:34:31,760 --> 03:34:34,080
club. But this

5234
03:34:32,800 --> 03:34:35,760
after all these years,

5235
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:37,840
this must be a very difficult one

5236
03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:39,920
because you're also a leader of the

5237
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:42,479
sponge fan club as well. Yeah, I have

5238
03:34:39,920 --> 03:34:45,200
this issue a lot um as I do kind of just

5239
03:34:42,479 --> 03:34:48,000
get attached to players and then am in

5240
03:34:45,200 --> 03:34:51,120
inner turmoil when they face off.

5241
03:34:48,000 --> 03:34:54,080
We'll see. DRX, they really are a team

5242
03:34:51,120 --> 03:34:57,439
that I think very often

5243
03:34:54,080 --> 03:34:57,840
wins or falls with Sponge's performance.

5244
03:34:57,439 --> 03:35:00,319
Yep.

5245
03:34:57,840 --> 03:35:03,040
Um he's just he's just Sponge. Sometimes

5246
03:35:00,319 --> 03:35:04,960
he's great, sometimes he's not. But the

5247
03:35:03,040 --> 03:35:07,439
big difference with Bro is that I think

5248
03:35:04,960 --> 03:35:09,200
as good as Kroko has been really kind of

5249
03:35:07,439 --> 03:35:11,279
convincing all of us cuz we were all

5250
03:35:09,200 --> 03:35:14,479
skeptical when Hanukkah was subbed out,

5251
03:35:11,279 --> 03:35:15,200
Krokco was announced as a sign. Even me

5252
03:35:14,479 --> 03:35:17,200
obviously

5253
03:35:15,200 --> 03:35:18,880
especially made no sense at all.

5254
03:35:17,200 --> 03:35:21,520
You were way you and Wolf were way ahead

5255
03:35:18,880 --> 03:35:23,040
of me. I think I I was obviously cuz I

5256
03:35:21,520 --> 03:35:25,279
have a soft spot for Kroko. I was a

5257
03:35:23,040 --> 03:35:28,000
little bit more willing but even I

5258
03:35:25,279 --> 03:35:29,600
thought that given what Hback showed his

5259
03:35:28,000 --> 03:35:31,600
heist, I don't know if it was warranted.

5260
03:35:29,600 --> 03:35:33,520
It has been. Crocco has transformed his

5261
03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:35,920
team, but much more important, I think

5262
03:35:33,520 --> 03:35:38,800
that bro have other threats as well.

5263
03:35:35,920 --> 03:35:41,120
We've seen Hype finally lean into what

5264
03:35:38,800 --> 03:35:42,640
he used to do in challengers. We've seen

5265
03:35:41,120 --> 03:35:45,840
Morgan with I think the biggest

5266
03:35:42,640 --> 03:35:48,160
Cho'Gath, the widest cho I have seen in

5267
03:35:45,840 --> 03:35:51,120
a long time. And then we have Closer,

5268
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:53,040
who right now, and I think by a large

5269
03:35:51,120 --> 03:35:54,640
margin, is the best mid laner they have

5270
03:35:53,040 --> 03:35:56,479
in the Rise group. I don't I don't think

5271
03:35:54,640 --> 03:35:58,000
anyone come really comes close.

5272
03:35:56,479 --> 03:36:00,000
Nope. It's a little bit of a shame if

5273
03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:02,000
you're a Showmaker fan, but that is just

5274
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:02,880
the fact of it, unfortunately.

5275
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:05,279
I'm right here.

5276
03:36:02,880 --> 03:36:07,279
Yep. Yeah, don't worry. I am too and

5277
03:36:05,279 --> 03:36:09,840
we're both sort of hurting um after that

5278
03:36:07,279 --> 03:36:11,040
last one. Still Bros going from strength

5279
03:36:09,840 --> 03:36:13,920
to strength and we'll see whether they

5280
03:36:11,040 --> 03:36:15,359
can find an angle here up against DRX

5281
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:16,960
because it's still looking like the Bros

5282
03:36:15,359 --> 03:36:18,560
are going to be safe here in the Rise

5283
03:36:16,960 --> 03:36:20,319
group right now from their position

5284
03:36:18,560 --> 03:36:21,680
where they're sitting. But DRX are

5285
03:36:20,319 --> 03:36:23,439
pretty close to them, right? Like they

5286
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:25,760
are the threat that's coming from the

5287
03:36:23,439 --> 03:36:27,359
bottom of the standings. Uh DNF not

5288
03:36:25,760 --> 03:36:30,080
likely to overtake with their one

5289
03:36:27,359 --> 03:36:32,319
victory that they have picked up so far.

5290
03:36:30,080 --> 03:36:33,920
And so Bros wanting to create some

5291
03:36:32,319 --> 03:36:34,720
distance between themselves and DRX.

5292
03:36:33,920 --> 03:36:36,720
It's kind of important here.

5293
03:36:34,720 --> 03:36:39,279
It's actually interesting cuz the two of

5294
03:36:36,720 --> 03:36:41,359
the Bros wins in series were DK. Like

5295
03:36:39,279 --> 03:36:43,680
all one they also two zero DK which

5296
03:36:41,359 --> 03:36:46,000
actually ended up costing DK the in

5297
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:47,840
hindsight if they had 2-1 they wouldn't

5298
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:50,160
have had the tiebreaker. Exactly. It was

5299
03:36:47,840 --> 03:36:52,080
it was a crazy set of circumstances. Uh

5300
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:53,359
but bro have really struggled taking on

5301
03:36:52,080 --> 03:36:55,120
Eastern teams. That's actually the most

5302
03:36:53,359 --> 03:36:56,640
interesting part. And their consistency

5303
03:36:55,120 --> 03:36:59,120
was something that actually Duke, who

5304
03:36:56,640 --> 03:37:00,800
obviously now is their uh new head coach

5305
03:36:59,120 --> 03:37:02,640
commented on. He's like, "Guys, I think

5306
03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:05,200
that the peaks that we hit are actually

5307
03:37:02,640 --> 03:37:07,520
really respectable, but the floor when

5308
03:37:05,200 --> 03:37:10,000
we play bad, it is really rough. And my

5309
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:12,960
goal, as we see him right there, is to

5310
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:14,800
ensure that we don't hit those lows. I

5311
03:37:12,960 --> 03:37:16,239
just want to crank up at average level

5312
03:37:14,800 --> 03:37:18,319
cuz we know the highs are there, but

5313
03:37:16,239 --> 03:37:20,080
we've also seen Bro go from looking good

5314
03:37:18,319 --> 03:37:21,840
to just not doing anything three games

5315
03:37:20,080 --> 03:37:25,120
in a row and just kind of losing."

5316
03:37:21,840 --> 03:37:28,640
Yeah. And if they can get rid of those

5317
03:37:25,120 --> 03:37:30,319
lows, I think they could be very well in

5318
03:37:28,640 --> 03:37:32,319
contention for the first place spot

5319
03:37:30,319 --> 03:37:34,239
right with TK in a complete free fall

5320
03:37:32,319 --> 03:37:35,680
right now, but has to start here with a

5321
03:37:34,239 --> 03:37:38,640
dominant victory. Yep. We'll see whether

5322
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:40,160
the Bros can make it a perfect week here

5323
03:37:38,640 --> 03:37:42,640
or whether it's going to be DRX coming

5324
03:37:40,160 --> 03:37:44,479
out with a bang with a bit of a newish

5325
03:37:42,640 --> 03:37:47,359
roster in comparison to what we've been

5326
03:37:44,479 --> 03:37:49,040
seeing from them prior. Right. Um Teddy

5327
03:37:47,359 --> 03:37:51,279
making his way back. I'm not sure what

5328
03:37:49,040 --> 03:37:53,840
to feel often times. I like I'm a huge

5329
03:37:51,279 --> 03:37:56,800
Teddy fan, but I just don't think that

5330
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:58,640
he's necessarily had those same uh level

5331
03:37:56,800 --> 03:38:00,720
of performances that we've seen in the

5332
03:37:58,640 --> 03:38:04,000
past, right? Like back on the Glory Jin

5333
03:38:00,720 --> 03:38:06,560
Air days or, you know, on that 2019 SKT

5334
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:08,319
roster that looked so incredibly good um

5335
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:10,960
at least, you know, domestically that

5336
03:38:08,319 --> 03:38:12,960
year. Uh it's just has kind of been

5337
03:38:10,960 --> 03:38:14,239
shades of his former self is good old

5338
03:38:12,960 --> 03:38:16,000
Teddy. And we'll see whether he can buck

5339
03:38:14,239 --> 03:38:18,479
that trend, turn that one around, have a

5340
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:20,080
bit of a renaissance here.

5341
03:38:18,479 --> 03:38:22,160
But so far we've got the Nico and the

5342
03:38:20,080 --> 03:38:24,479
Gwen taken away. Pantheon is going to be

5343
03:38:22,160 --> 03:38:26,880
the answering ban as the Azir is also

5344
03:38:24,479 --> 03:38:29,439
going to hit the deck. Um probably less

5345
03:38:26,880 --> 03:38:31,680
likely that we see Tia focus I guess as

5346
03:38:29,439 --> 03:38:34,800
often times it is a bit of like we're

5347
03:38:31,680 --> 03:38:37,200
fishing for an Azia first pick type ban

5348
03:38:34,800 --> 03:38:40,239
but Vi is still up. Varys is still up.

5349
03:38:37,200 --> 03:38:41,920
These are the important ones.

5350
03:38:40,239 --> 03:38:45,279
Looking at the Varys, looking at the

5351
03:38:41,920 --> 03:38:48,880
Rumble as well has been a main stay for

5352
03:38:45,279 --> 03:38:50,640
such a long time. We'll get Morgan Yoro,

5353
03:38:48,880 --> 03:38:53,279
you know, one of the one of our our

5354
03:38:50,640 --> 03:38:55,840
resident actual Yoro players.

5355
03:38:53,279 --> 03:38:57,439
The first one to win on it

5356
03:38:55,840 --> 03:39:00,800
so far this season with the new

5357
03:38:57,439 --> 03:39:02,720
iteration of the Yoro. Zenzou still open

5358
03:39:00,800 --> 03:39:04,319
as well. I think that we saw in the last

5359
03:39:02,720 --> 03:39:06,399
game what kind of power pick that can

5360
03:39:04,319 --> 03:39:08,000
still be.

5361
03:39:06,399 --> 03:39:10,319
Might just be the vibe, but I mean we

5362
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:12,239
have seen that like a lot of teams

5363
03:39:10,319 --> 03:39:14,000
pretty happy to pick whatever into it,

5364
03:39:12,239 --> 03:39:16,399
take the Wukong away, things like that.

5365
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:18,160
We have seen find a lot of success. So

5366
03:39:16,399 --> 03:39:19,840
maybe that priority is going to fall

5367
03:39:18,160 --> 03:39:21,520
down. Taking a lot of time to think

5368
03:39:19,840 --> 03:39:23,120
about it as the Tia ban will still come

5369
03:39:21,520 --> 03:39:24,399
through. Not wanting to give that one

5370
03:39:23,120 --> 03:39:25,920
over to Closer. I think a little bit

5371
03:39:24,399 --> 03:39:27,760
understandable when it is closer that

5372
03:39:25,920 --> 03:39:31,200
you're facing off against Tia has been

5373
03:39:27,760 --> 03:39:32,800
fantastic so far in 2025, but he does

5374
03:39:31,200 --> 03:39:34,319
have a lot of other picks that he can

5375
03:39:32,800 --> 03:39:36,160
certainly go towards. We'll see what the

5376
03:39:34,319 --> 03:39:38,239
first pick is actually going to be here.

5377
03:39:36,160 --> 03:39:40,239
Aurora still up as well.

5378
03:39:38,239 --> 03:39:41,760
I think that's going to be B1, but is a

5379
03:39:40,239 --> 03:39:43,359
definitely a power pick and it does

5380
03:39:41,760 --> 03:39:45,520
really fit with Closer's play style as

5381
03:39:43,359 --> 03:39:47,040
well. There are things like Lucian that

5382
03:39:45,520 --> 03:39:48,239
we've seen a lot of teams prioritizing

5383
03:39:47,040 --> 03:39:50,479
pretty highly, but instead it will be

5384
03:39:48,239 --> 03:39:53,200
the Annie like we saw in our first game

5385
03:39:50,479 --> 03:39:55,680
of our previous series. That one will be

5386
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:58,080
locked in with Vi left up and available

5387
03:39:55,680 --> 03:40:00,720
as well. So, we could interestingly have

5388
03:39:58,080 --> 03:40:03,680
a very similar draft uh to what we saw

5389
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:05,200
from T1 coming out of the Bros. Let's

5390
03:40:03,680 --> 03:40:08,479
see what DRX are going to answer this

5391
03:40:05,200 --> 03:40:11,279
with. Rumble is up. That's rich. I mean,

5392
03:40:08,479 --> 03:40:13,120
need I say more? Could just be

5393
03:40:11,279 --> 03:40:15,680
I don't think you do. I think the Rumble

5394
03:40:13,120 --> 03:40:17,120
would make a ton of sense here.

5395
03:40:15,680 --> 03:40:21,040
Well, Wukong.

5396
03:40:17,120 --> 03:40:23,359
Yeah, that's it's a it's a decent combo.

5397
03:40:21,040 --> 03:40:24,640
We also see this uh Wukong Priority

5398
03:40:23,359 --> 03:40:26,479
definitely one of the best junglers of

5399
03:40:24,640 --> 03:40:28,479
the patch. Also has a good match up into

5400
03:40:26,479 --> 03:40:29,840
Divi, which again, we talked about this

5401
03:40:28,479 --> 03:40:31,040
exact thing. Yeah,

5402
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:33,520
not 2 hours ago.

5403
03:40:31,040 --> 03:40:34,880
This draft has happened before. It It

5404
03:40:33,520 --> 03:40:37,040
really has. Uh it's going to be the

5405
03:40:34,880 --> 03:40:38,960
Aurora takeaway instead though, which

5406
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:40,239
Oh, bit of Rumble Denial as well. Means

5407
03:40:38,960 --> 03:40:42,160
that Morgan won't be able to lock that

5408
03:40:40,239 --> 03:40:43,920
one away safely.

5409
03:40:42,160 --> 03:40:46,960
I'm not going to lie. I think if you're

5410
03:40:43,920 --> 03:40:48,560
Morgan into Rich, I don't I think Aurora

5411
03:40:46,960 --> 03:40:50,479
top has a pretty high barrier of

5412
03:40:48,560 --> 03:40:54,000
execution. I know that matchup is rough,

5413
03:40:50,479 --> 03:40:55,680
but we'll see. Rich has uh found ways to

5414
03:40:54,000 --> 03:40:57,200
surprise me before.

5415
03:40:55,680 --> 03:40:58,640
Yeah, it doesn't really feel like a rich

5416
03:40:57,200 --> 03:41:01,200
champion. Uh I think you might be

5417
03:40:58,640 --> 03:41:01,600
alluding to his champion pool situation.

5418
03:41:01,200 --> 03:41:04,479
Yeah.

5419
03:41:01,600 --> 03:41:06,640
Uh Z going to be the option instead of

5420
03:41:04,479 --> 03:41:08,479
something like a VI. I do like this a

5421
03:41:06,640 --> 03:41:10,640
lot more. The setup that you have gets

5422
03:41:08,479 --> 03:41:12,720
the Zin in there. stack that knock up

5423
03:41:10,640 --> 03:41:14,479
while the uh stun is coming on through

5424
03:41:12,720 --> 03:41:15,680
from the Annie. I like it a lot. And the

5425
03:41:14,479 --> 03:41:18,319
Alistister is actually going to be the

5426
03:41:15,680 --> 03:41:21,600
choice here for Polo who had a bit of a

5427
03:41:18,319 --> 03:41:24,479
stinker in game one against DK and then

5428
03:41:21,600 --> 03:41:26,479
came back and smashed them. Look looked

5429
03:41:24,479 --> 03:41:28,640
absolutely fantastic in the next two

5430
03:41:26,479 --> 03:41:30,160
games of that series. We'll see whether

5431
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:32,960
he can find that form earlier on. This

5432
03:41:30,160 --> 03:41:34,960
is a pivotal pick and a very big one

5433
03:41:32,960 --> 03:41:37,279
that Okay, bro can certainly take

5434
03:41:34,960 --> 03:41:38,800
advantage of as a Poppy is being

5435
03:41:37,279 --> 03:41:40,080
considered. This is a favorite for

5436
03:41:38,800 --> 03:41:41,840
Sponge in the past, but he's already

5437
03:41:40,080 --> 03:41:43,279
playing a Wukong. So, this would be for

5438
03:41:41,840 --> 03:41:44,080
Andal there towards the bottom side of

5439
03:41:43,279 --> 03:41:45,200
the map.

5440
03:41:44,080 --> 03:41:46,960
Yeah, unless they were going to get

5441
03:41:45,200 --> 03:41:48,319
waved with it and flex at the top. We

5442
03:41:46,960 --> 03:41:49,840
have seen that Poppy top in some

5443
03:41:48,319 --> 03:41:51,120
matchups. Keen has pulled that one out a

5444
03:41:49,840 --> 03:41:52,479
few times. True.

5445
03:41:51,120 --> 03:41:54,880
Don't think that's likely though.

5446
03:41:52,479 --> 03:41:57,439
Probably just going to be on this. So,

5447
03:41:54,880 --> 03:41:58,560
no AD carry have been picked yet.

5448
03:41:57,439 --> 03:42:01,680
Something we're going to look towards as

5449
03:41:58,560 --> 03:42:04,160
well as top. Now, DRX can obviously

5450
03:42:01,680 --> 03:42:05,439
keep that top lane match up for R5,

5451
03:42:04,160 --> 03:42:07,279
which I would love. Just pick an AD

5452
03:42:05,439 --> 03:42:09,840
carry here on four. You can go a lot of

5453
03:42:07,279 --> 03:42:11,520
different directions. Jin to me always

5454
03:42:09,840 --> 03:42:13,359
makes sense because you want to not be

5455
03:42:11,520 --> 03:42:14,640
anywhere near the Annie or the Zenzo and

5456
03:42:13,359 --> 03:42:16,239
you have a lot of damage in the rest of

5457
03:42:14,640 --> 03:42:17,439
your comp already. So I think it is

5458
03:42:16,239 --> 03:42:18,720
something you can definitely get away

5459
03:42:17,439 --> 03:42:20,880
with.

5460
03:42:18,720 --> 03:42:25,040
Siver going to be taken away here from

5461
03:42:20,880 --> 03:42:26,319
hype. C we saw rising to some popularity

5462
03:42:25,040 --> 03:42:28,960
over the last couple of weeks on the

5463
03:42:26,319 --> 03:42:31,279
previous patch and the Oriana going to

5464
03:42:28,960 --> 03:42:32,800
be taken away from Yahoo as that would

5465
03:42:31,279 --> 03:42:34,479
be a pretty scary top side. Although a

5466
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:36,800
lot of magic damage. Jahu with a lot of

5467
03:42:34,479 --> 03:42:38,880
options as far as what he wants to play.

5468
03:42:36,800 --> 03:42:39,200
Teddy was of course a bit of a Ziggs

5469
03:42:38,880 --> 03:42:41,680
guy.

5470
03:42:39,200 --> 03:42:44,560
It's also interesting cuz like this

5471
03:42:41,680 --> 03:42:46,319
Oriana ban is they're kind of still

5472
03:42:44,560 --> 03:42:47,920
hedging their bets, right, as to where

5473
03:42:46,319 --> 03:42:49,920
this Aurora is actually going to go.

5474
03:42:47,920 --> 03:42:51,279
Y because we don't know for a fact it's

5475
03:42:49,920 --> 03:42:52,239
going to go one way or another. I

5476
03:42:51,279 --> 03:42:53,439
definitely do think it's one of the

5477
03:42:52,239 --> 03:42:55,760
match ups you can play into Annie

5478
03:42:53,439 --> 03:42:57,680
because you have uh ways to actually

5479
03:42:55,760 --> 03:43:00,960
trade with her even if you do get into a

5480
03:42:57,680 --> 03:43:03,439
range and you have a ton of safety

5481
03:43:00,960 --> 03:43:06,880
already outside of uh flash bears. I

5482
03:43:03,439 --> 03:43:09,760
think you do have uh a lot of ways to

5483
03:43:06,880 --> 03:43:11,439
make plays there. Mr. Senna taken away

5484
03:43:09,760 --> 03:43:13,680
as well. Do you want to know something

5485
03:43:11,439 --> 03:43:15,920
fun? Hit me. The first letter of all of

5486
03:43:13,680 --> 03:43:17,840
the names that DRX have banned spells

5487
03:43:15,920 --> 03:43:20,720
Pats,

5488
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:23,040
which is kind of cute.

5489
03:43:20,720 --> 03:43:24,000
Oh, okay. With a double S. But

5490
03:43:23,040 --> 03:43:25,600
with a double S.

5491
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:26,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Pat, it's still

5492
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:29,840
Pats.

5493
03:43:26,160 --> 03:43:31,359
But is Pats even a name? No. Pats as in

5494
03:43:29,840 --> 03:43:32,000
Oh, it's a pet with a doggo.

5495
03:43:31,359 --> 03:43:35,279
Ah.

5496
03:43:32,000 --> 03:43:35,760
Pato. That That's with an eo, not an a,

5497
03:43:35,279 --> 03:43:37,600
right?

5498
03:43:35,760 --> 03:43:39,199
What? No, pet. That That would be You

5499
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:39,840
can pet a dog, but you can also pat a

5500
03:43:39,199 --> 03:43:42,800
dog.

5501
03:43:39,840 --> 03:43:44,560
Oh, you're right. Yeah.

5502
03:43:42,800 --> 03:43:46,800
In a When I was growing up, we didn't do

5503
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:48,640
like we didn't say, "Can I pet the dog?"

5504
03:43:46,800 --> 03:43:49,760
We'd always only say, "Can I pat the

5505
03:43:48,640 --> 03:43:51,600
dog?"

5506
03:43:49,760 --> 03:43:54,399
So, I didn't really understand what pet

5507
03:43:51,600 --> 03:43:56,720
meant as a verb cuz a pet is your pet.

5508
03:43:54,399 --> 03:43:58,960
Yeah. No, I'm I'm also quickly quickly

5509
03:43:56,720 --> 03:44:00,239
losing the plot. Um, but I do I am happy

5510
03:43:58,960 --> 03:44:01,120
you pointed it out cuz I would have not

5511
03:44:00,239 --> 03:44:03,040
have known it otherwise.

5512
03:44:01,120 --> 03:44:05,439
There we go. Now everyone knows and now

5513
03:44:03,040 --> 03:44:06,640
we're completely off track. The miss cuz

5514
03:44:05,439 --> 03:44:08,319
we knew this is what we were saying.

5515
03:44:06,640 --> 03:44:08,880
They're picking a carry on four.

5516
03:44:08,319 --> 03:44:10,080
Yeah.

5517
03:44:08,880 --> 03:44:12,000
And then they're going to counter pick

5518
03:44:10,080 --> 03:44:13,520
for Rich, which is going to be Atrox cuz

5519
03:44:12,000 --> 03:44:14,319
it's Ridge.

5520
03:44:13,520 --> 03:44:16,239
That's my guess.

5521
03:44:14,319 --> 03:44:18,640
There's a Scion for Morgan. That's why

5522
03:44:16,239 --> 03:44:21,680
I'm saying we're going to need some big

5523
03:44:18,640 --> 03:44:24,399
damage here from Hype. Let's see what it

5524
03:44:21,680 --> 03:44:25,680
is going to be. Pol's taking his time

5525
03:44:24,399 --> 03:44:28,560
figuring out what are we going to be

5526
03:44:25,680 --> 03:44:30,560
playing into this Corki.

5527
03:44:28,560 --> 03:44:32,560
Corki has a lot of safety as well into

5528
03:44:30,560 --> 03:44:34,479
what the amount of dive that is

5529
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:36,960
available. Now, there is still the

5530
03:44:34,479 --> 03:44:39,600
potential for this to not be a rich pick

5531
03:44:36,960 --> 03:44:41,920
and just put the Aurora at the top, but

5532
03:44:39,600 --> 03:44:44,080
Ambessa kind of conceding the early

5533
03:44:41,920 --> 03:44:45,600
lane, but having even more dive and with

5534
03:44:44,080 --> 03:44:47,760
this comp, I think that makes sense.

5535
03:44:45,600 --> 03:44:49,120
Yep. Extra tool to lock people down as

5536
03:44:47,760 --> 03:44:51,359
well for the Nefold.

5537
03:44:49,120 --> 03:44:53,520
And she has been a pretty good pick into

5538
03:44:51,359 --> 03:44:56,000
Zion that we've seen develop over the

5539
03:44:53,520 --> 03:44:58,640
last little while. So, an understandable

5540
03:44:56,000 --> 03:45:00,399
choice there. But of course, Morgan very

5541
03:44:58,640 --> 03:45:02,960
happy to just be a bit of a potato,

5542
03:45:00,399 --> 03:45:04,640
weather the storm, and then take control

5543
03:45:02,960 --> 03:45:06,399
in team fight. Scion and Alistister

5544
03:45:04,640 --> 03:45:09,199
together are going to be able to create

5545
03:45:06,399 --> 03:45:12,640
so much space here on the map for the

5546
03:45:09,199 --> 03:45:15,520
bros. And then Annie, Tibbers, and Corky

5547
03:45:12,640 --> 03:45:17,199
can get to work.

5548
03:45:15,520 --> 03:45:19,520
I I just can't get over the image of

5549
03:45:17,199 --> 03:45:21,760
Morgan the potato. Good.

5550
03:45:19,520 --> 03:45:24,000
I mean, he's just he's the it's the

5551
03:45:21,760 --> 03:45:26,319
potato train, you know? you just fly

5552
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:28,880
into a team fight, hop off the rails,

5553
03:45:26,319 --> 03:45:30,560
and run a muck.

5554
03:45:28,880 --> 03:45:32,319
I think both drafts have things to look

5555
03:45:30,560 --> 03:45:35,279
forward to. I think the DRX draft, my

5556
03:45:32,319 --> 03:45:36,960
main qual with it is that the burden of

5557
03:45:35,279 --> 03:45:38,160
execution is a lot higher. I don't think

5558
03:45:36,960 --> 03:45:40,880
it's quite that easy to play. I think

5559
03:45:38,160 --> 03:45:42,720
you need to be very in sync with all

5560
03:45:40,880 --> 03:45:44,720
your team because you need to make sure

5561
03:45:42,720 --> 03:45:46,720
you hit the CC. This is uh this is

5562
03:45:44,720 --> 03:45:49,199
actually the newest evolution in fan

5563
03:45:46,720 --> 03:45:51,520
signs that I haven't this like I haven't

5564
03:45:49,199 --> 03:45:52,239
seen this before. the Levi opening up

5565
03:45:51,520 --> 03:45:54,239
the

5566
03:45:52,239 --> 03:45:57,120
That's great. And I assume it's cuz he's

5567
03:45:54,239 --> 03:45:58,319
a sponge, so he cleans as Levi does in

5568
03:45:57,120 --> 03:46:00,720
that

5569
03:45:58,319 --> 03:46:02,560
that play. That That's good stuff.

5570
03:46:00,720 --> 03:46:03,439
And and that that that's attack on

5571
03:46:02,560 --> 03:46:06,160
Titans, isn't it?

5572
03:46:03,439 --> 03:46:07,600
It is. I see. I know. An amin.

5573
03:46:06,160 --> 03:46:09,840
Okay. I know you're just saying this to

5574
03:46:07,600 --> 03:46:11,520
infury me and it's working. Good job.

5575
03:46:09,840 --> 03:46:15,300
You're welcome. All right. It's time to

5576
03:46:11,520 --> 03:46:18,410
get to some actual fan chance. Let's go.

5577
03:46:15,300 --> 03:46:18,410
[Music]

5578
03:46:21,050 --> 03:46:30,560
[Applause]

5579
03:46:27,480 --> 03:46:32,720
[Music]

5580
03:46:30,560 --> 03:46:34,319
I'm really glad that uh Chad appreciates

5581
03:46:32,720 --> 03:46:35,680
Ammon.

5582
03:46:34,319 --> 03:46:37,680
That one I'm never going to stop using

5583
03:46:35,680 --> 03:46:40,000
for the rest of my life. Feels good.

5584
03:46:37,680 --> 03:46:40,399
You know, that's a that's a rapper as

5585
03:46:40,000 --> 03:46:40,800
well.

5586
03:46:40,399 --> 03:46:41,120
Really?

5587
03:46:40,800 --> 03:46:42,319
Yeah.

5588
03:46:41,120 --> 03:46:42,880
Isn't that Eminem?

5589
03:46:42,319 --> 03:46:43,600
No.

5590
03:46:42,880 --> 03:46:44,479
Oh,

5591
03:46:43,600 --> 03:46:45,359
he's good.

5592
03:46:44,479 --> 03:46:48,080
Well, there you go.

5593
03:46:45,359 --> 03:46:50,239
Yeah, that's a new one. Speaking of

5594
03:46:48,080 --> 03:46:53,359
rappers, you know that guy that um uses

5595
03:46:50,239 --> 03:46:54,640
samples from all of the Ocarina of Time.

5596
03:46:53,359 --> 03:46:56,720
No, but that sounds very cool.

5597
03:46:54,640 --> 03:46:58,399
And then remixes them with like famous

5598
03:46:56,720 --> 03:46:59,359
um

5599
03:46:58,399 --> 03:47:00,720
rap songs.

5600
03:46:59,359 --> 03:47:03,359
No, but that sounds very cool.

5601
03:47:00,720 --> 03:47:04,399
It's It's called um Ocarina of Rhyme.

5602
03:47:03,359 --> 03:47:06,560
It's on YouTube.

5603
03:47:04,399 --> 03:47:09,439
Sounds really good. I

5604
03:47:06,560 --> 03:47:10,800
The one with the Goron City theme is

5605
03:47:09,439 --> 03:47:12,399
just the best.

5606
03:47:10,800 --> 03:47:13,600
I will look it up when I get home if I

5607
03:47:12,399 --> 03:47:14,960

song in like Goran village? Do you want

to sing it a little bit just in case

5615
03:47:23,359 --> 03:47:26,399
people don't remember?

5616
03:47:24,319 --> 03:47:27,120
No, I do not want to do that. Uh for

5617
03:47:26,399 --> 03:47:28,479
many reasons.

03:47:27,120 --> 03:47:30,000
Do you want me to try?

03:47:28,479 --> 03:47:32,000
I'm very happy to listen.

03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:34,080
It is a very it's a very uncomfortable

5621
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:36,319
take take it away at

5622
03:47:34,080 --> 03:47:37,680
well it's bro and brew. We got we got

5623
03:47:36,319 --> 03:47:39,279
you got 15 minutes.

5624
03:47:37,680 --> 03:47:39,600
Something you can do in a bro and brew

5625
03:47:39,279 --> 03:47:41,760
that.

5626
03:47:39,600 --> 03:47:43,359
We don't we don't we're not in any rush.

5627
03:47:41,760 --> 03:47:44,880
Everyone know everyone's that that's

5628
03:47:43,359 --> 03:47:46,080
here right now knows this as well.

5629
03:47:44,880 --> 03:47:49,720
Yeah. Okay. That's a good point. It's

5630
03:47:46,080 --> 03:47:49,720
the one that goes like

5631
03:47:50,239 --> 03:47:52,880
that one, you know?

5632
03:47:51,439 --> 03:47:54,880
Yeah. I

5633
03:47:52,880 --> 03:47:57,680
I feel like I didn't do it justice. It's

5634
03:47:54,880 --> 03:48:01,840
been a while since I've uh lie to when

5635
03:47:57,680 --> 03:48:04,160
it comes to a time. Mine is a

5636
03:48:01,840 --> 03:48:04,800
you you know the one

5637
03:48:04,160 --> 03:48:06,720
that one.

5638
03:48:04,800 --> 03:48:09,520
Yeah. But I don't want to do too much.

5639
03:48:06,720 --> 03:48:11,600
I'm I'm you know I want to I guess it's

5640
03:48:09,520 --> 03:48:13,520
fine. We can hum. I think we got we got

5641
03:48:11,600 --> 03:48:16,399
plenty of uh plenty of humming in our

5642
03:48:13,520 --> 03:48:18,640
future if this series is going to go the

5643
03:48:16,399 --> 03:48:20,319
way we expected to. As you mentioned

5644
03:48:18,640 --> 03:48:22,880
prior, you can see some full clearing

5645
03:48:20,319 --> 03:48:24,880
going on between our two junglers.

5646
03:48:22,880 --> 03:48:26,239
Closer and Yahoo are just hanging out.

5647
03:48:24,880 --> 03:48:28,560
It's probably the best we've seen an

5648
03:48:26,239 --> 03:48:29,680
Annie do in the early levels against a

5649
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:31,680
Aurora,

5650
03:48:29,680 --> 03:48:34,960
as I say it.

5651
03:48:31,680 --> 03:48:36,479
Um I I was wondering about this. So, cuz

5652
03:48:34,960 --> 03:48:38,800
if I remember correctly, but I wanted

5653
03:48:36,479 --> 03:48:41,359
your check on this as well. The

5654
03:48:38,800 --> 03:48:43,760
inventors of the term bro and brew were

5655
03:48:41,359 --> 03:48:45,040
Brendan Feld and and Wolf. Yeah. Yeah.

5656
03:48:43,760 --> 03:48:46,479
Yeah. They were the Bro and Brew.

5657
03:48:45,040 --> 03:48:48,399
The Bro and Brew and Yeah. the

5658
03:48:46,479 --> 03:48:50,640
originators. Yeah.

5659
03:48:48,399 --> 03:48:51,600
Um cuz I I I don't know. I got in a

5660
03:48:50,640 --> 03:48:53,760
conversation with someone about this

5661
03:48:51,600 --> 03:48:54,960
recently. I'm like I'm 99% sure it was

5662
03:48:53,760 --> 03:48:55,439
the two of them.

5663
03:48:54,960 --> 03:48:57,439
It was.

5664
03:48:55,439 --> 03:48:58,720
And I'm glad to be have that. I It's

5665
03:48:57,439 --> 03:48:59,760
important that we keep track of the lore

5666
03:48:58,720 --> 03:49:01,120
of the LCK.

5667
03:48:59,760 --> 03:49:02,000
Yeah. You got to work out where the

5668
03:49:01,120 --> 03:49:03,840
origins are.

5669
03:49:02,000 --> 03:49:06,160
Yeah. Well, we can't just

5670
03:49:03,840 --> 03:49:07,920
as just let that go. I'm sorry closer

5671
03:49:06,160 --> 03:49:10,160
for mention mentioning anything about

5672
03:49:07,920 --> 03:49:12,479
this lane being fun because it has

5673
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:13,600
discontinued to be fun. Did manage to

5674
03:49:12,479 --> 03:49:15,680
find at least a little bit back there.

5675
03:49:13,600 --> 03:49:18,160
That was actually a pretty good uh No,

5676
03:49:15,680 --> 03:49:20,080
no, no, no. It's still awful for Closer

5677
03:49:18,160 --> 03:49:23,439
having a terrible time.

5678
03:49:20,080 --> 03:49:25,439
Don't worry for I got your back.

5679
03:49:23,439 --> 03:49:25,760
Hopping on throughout the Let's be real

5680
03:49:25,439 --> 03:49:27,120
here.

5681
03:49:25,760 --> 03:49:28,960
Oh yeah, that's true. I mean

5682
03:49:27,120 --> 03:49:29,840
is the What's the What's the tech

5683
03:49:28,960 --> 03:49:32,319
situation by the way?

5684
03:49:29,840 --> 03:49:34,640
The Britex. I mean I got mine in and we

5685
03:49:32,319 --> 03:49:37,920
do have a Oh, here we go. Got another

5686
03:49:34,640 --> 03:49:40,160
highlighted one talking about scrambling

5687
03:49:37,920 --> 03:49:41,920
some eggs and stuff and there's barrel.

5688
03:49:40,160 --> 03:49:42,800
Watch too much barrel. Yeah, that's uh

5689
03:49:41,920 --> 03:49:45,120
honestly

5690
03:49:42,800 --> 03:49:46,880
that's what that that may have broken

5691
03:49:45,120 --> 03:49:49,359
our brain. That's why I'm singing gor on

5692
03:49:46,880 --> 03:49:50,560
city theme. But honestly, Ocarina of

5693
03:49:49,359 --> 03:49:51,520
Rhyme, look it up. It's amazing. It's

5694
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:53,120
incredible.

5695
03:49:51,520 --> 03:49:55,760
And that one I think it's ASOP.

5696
03:49:53,120 --> 03:49:57,520
Oh, I didn't tell you my favorite. Uh

5697
03:49:55,760 --> 03:50:00,720
actually, you would love this.

5698
03:49:57,520 --> 03:50:03,520
So, at MSI, I had a fan come up to me

5699
03:50:00,720 --> 03:50:05,520
and he was like, "Hey, so uh you know,

5700
03:50:03,520 --> 03:50:07,040
I'm sure you get me me and Draco were

5701
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:08,960
casting." He was like, "I'm sure you get

5702
03:50:07,040 --> 03:50:10,479
asked this a lot, but can you sign

5703
03:50:08,960 --> 03:50:11,680
something?" Like, "Yeah, no problem." I

5704
03:50:10,479 --> 03:50:12,880
was like, "It might be a little weird."

5705
03:50:11,680 --> 03:50:13,359
I'm like, "I don't know what's going to

5706
03:50:12,880 --> 03:50:13,760
happen."

5707
03:50:13,359 --> 03:50:16,000
Uhhuh.

5708
03:50:13,760 --> 03:50:18,319
And he pulls out

5709
03:50:16,000 --> 03:50:20,960
a Carly Ray Jeepson album.

5710
03:50:18,319 --> 03:50:22,640
He pulls out a motion atlas and then

5711
03:50:20,960 --> 03:50:24,319
obviously I I took a picture with him

5712
03:50:22,640 --> 03:50:25,279
cuz my guy, I need a picture with you.

5713
03:50:24,319 --> 03:50:27,120
That's amazing.

5714
03:50:25,279 --> 03:50:28,560
That is absolutely Sorry, I signed it.

5715
03:50:27,120 --> 03:50:31,120
And then he also had a really cool fight

5716
03:50:28,560 --> 03:50:32,160
stick that Draco Si signed as well. It

5717
03:50:31,120 --> 03:50:32,960
was just like it was

5718
03:50:32,160 --> 03:50:34,000
that is rad.

5719
03:50:32,960 --> 03:50:35,600
No, it was awesome.

5720
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:37,920
That's like bringing the right things to

5721
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:40,080
the party as gets knocked up momentarily

5722
03:50:37,920 --> 03:50:42,080
and it's an even trade.

5723
03:50:40,080 --> 03:50:43,920
Oh,

5724
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:44,800
this is

5725
03:50:43,920 --> 03:50:48,000
minutes at left.

5726
03:50:44,800 --> 03:50:50,399
This do be a bro and brew don't it?

5727
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:51,920
Very very nice. Organ is going to go

5728
03:50:50,399 --> 03:50:53,680
home for a moment. Yes.

5729
03:50:51,920 --> 03:50:55,920
Your your your beverage of choice. Are

5730
03:50:53,680 --> 03:50:57,840
you still part cuz I remember uh the tea

5731
03:50:55,920 --> 03:50:59,040
you make me I I still think of falling.

5732
03:50:57,840 --> 03:50:59,680
I want to say it was Australian

5733
03:50:59,040 --> 03:51:01,120
breakfast.

5734
03:50:59,680 --> 03:51:02,479
It was no Melbourne breakfast.

5735
03:51:01,120 --> 03:51:03,120
Melbourne. Oh, even better.

5736
03:51:02,479 --> 03:51:04,640
It's very nice.

5737
03:51:03,120 --> 03:51:07,920
It was It was good.

5738
03:51:04,640 --> 03:51:09,279
That's a That's a T2 if uh any uh any

5739
03:51:07,920 --> 03:51:11,279
Australians, they would know.

5740
03:51:09,279 --> 03:51:12,399
Can Can is it only an Australian

5741
03:51:11,279 --> 03:51:13,840
exclusive?

5742
03:51:12,399 --> 03:51:16,000
It's an Australian brand, but I think

5743
03:51:13,840 --> 03:51:17,760
you can get it kind of everywhere.

5744
03:51:16,000 --> 03:51:19,279
Probably can. I got a few bags left.

5745
03:51:17,760 --> 03:51:20,880
Oh my god. I had to look into that. That

5746
03:51:19,279 --> 03:51:22,960
sounds wonderful. Don't you worry about

5747
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:24,640
that one. They also sell a lot of like

5748
03:51:22,960 --> 03:51:25,199
really nice like mugs and stuff like

5749
03:51:24,640 --> 03:51:26,560
that.

5750
03:51:25,199 --> 03:51:27,760
I'm good in the mugs, but I definitely

5751
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:29,199
do want more of the tea.

5752
03:51:27,760 --> 03:51:31,279
Yeah, it's good. Good stuff.

5753
03:51:29,199 --> 03:51:32,800
It would be great. Now, imagine us

5754
03:51:31,279 --> 03:51:34,160
I know we could actually brew and brew

5755
03:51:32,800 --> 03:51:36,160
with brewing some tea

5756
03:51:34,160 --> 03:51:37,600
as almost did the thing.

5757
03:51:36,160 --> 03:51:38,000
Almost almost action there.

5758
03:51:37,600 --> 03:51:40,000
Yeah.

5759
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:43,199
Pre 10 minutes.

5760
03:51:40,000 --> 03:51:45,760
My bro versus TRX not happening. Um, two

5761
03:51:43,199 --> 03:51:48,239
teleports did get used. Wait, three of

5762
03:51:45,760 --> 03:51:49,920
them. I tell a lie. as Morgan did use

5763
03:51:48,239 --> 03:51:50,479
his to get back down towards the bottom

5764
03:51:49,920 --> 03:51:51,120
side.

5765
03:51:50,479 --> 03:51:54,160
Interesting.

5766
03:51:51,120 --> 03:51:56,800
As the lane swap has begun,

5767
03:51:54,160 --> 03:51:59,120
started here by the bros. Level six, the

5768
03:51:56,800 --> 03:52:00,000
train will be unleashed.

5769
03:51:59,120 --> 03:52:00,800
Not yet.

5770
03:52:00,000 --> 03:52:03,520
Choo choo.

5771
03:52:00,800 --> 03:52:04,880
Obviously, um because we need time. Do

5772
03:52:03,520 --> 03:52:07,920
you know what I did?

5773
03:52:04,880 --> 03:52:09,520
Tell me. I watched Pacific Rim.

5774
03:52:07,920 --> 03:52:09,760
Had you had you never watched it before

5775
03:52:09,520 --> 03:52:11,600
or

5776
03:52:09,760 --> 03:52:12,399
No, I've watched it many times, but it's

5777
03:52:11,600 --> 03:52:13,840
such a good play.

5778
03:52:12,399 --> 03:52:14,960
Oh, it holds up so well.

5779
03:52:13,840 --> 03:52:16,479
Oh, exceptional.

5780
03:52:14,960 --> 03:52:17,040
You know what I watched? What did you

5781
03:52:16,479 --> 03:52:18,399
watch?

5782
03:52:17,040 --> 03:52:19,920
Transformers 1.

5783
03:52:18,399 --> 03:52:20,880
Oh my. Same energy.

5784
03:52:19,920 --> 03:52:21,600
Wait, I know.

5785
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:24,720
Entirely.

5786
03:52:21,600 --> 03:52:25,920
I know, dude. I I that that movie

5787
03:52:24,720 --> 03:52:26,880
actually kind of blew me. It was way

5788
03:52:25,920 --> 03:52:28,319
better than I thought it was going.

5789
03:52:26,880 --> 03:52:29,359
Oh, dude. Transformers one is that

5790
03:52:28,319 --> 03:52:30,640
that's the good. They should have

5791
03:52:29,359 --> 03:52:32,640
stopped there.

5792
03:52:30,640 --> 03:52:33,600
Yeah, we've got an exhaust down. Cyclone

5793
03:52:32,640 --> 03:52:35,120
to answer it though. And there's a

5794
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:36,960
decoy. It's not exactly the target you

5795
03:52:35,120 --> 03:52:38,319
want to engage onto. Crocco does have

5796
03:52:36,960 --> 03:52:40,160
the crescent guard though as Yahoo is

5797
03:52:38,319 --> 03:52:41,359
just going to get inside the circle and

5798
03:52:40,160 --> 03:52:43,439
see whether he can get something done.

5799
03:52:41,359 --> 03:52:46,000
And the answer is he absolutely can

5800
03:52:43,439 --> 03:52:47,520
before he dies. Closer now looking for

5801
03:52:46,000 --> 03:52:50,399
some angles here as Tibis is going

5802
03:52:47,520 --> 03:52:52,640
ballistic. He picks up a double kill.

5803
03:52:50,399 --> 03:52:57,199
And this is why you do not underestimate

5804
03:52:52,640 --> 03:53:00,080
the big burning bear. Burn bear burn as

5805
03:52:57,199 --> 03:53:03,359
Sponge and Yahoo go down. Nicely done

5806
03:53:00,080 --> 03:53:06,640
there by the Bros in the extended fight

5807
03:53:03,359 --> 03:53:08,399
as it is an early skirmish. I thought

5808
03:53:06,640 --> 03:53:09,840
with the power of Cyclone, maybe they

5809
03:53:08,399 --> 03:53:13,279
could have uh could have gotten

5810
03:53:09,840 --> 03:53:14,960
something going, but it is the extended

5811
03:53:13,279 --> 03:53:16,880
chase there onto Crocco that I think

5812
03:53:14,960 --> 03:53:18,960
ends up costing them their lives as as

5813
03:53:16,880 --> 03:53:20,080
you highlight those damage shots for

5814
03:53:18,960 --> 03:53:21,199
Clos is going to be feeling really good

5815
03:53:20,080 --> 03:53:22,399
in that one. I don't think they have

5816
03:53:21,199 --> 03:53:23,439
kill threat here, but maybe they get a

5817
03:53:22,399 --> 03:53:24,560
summoner or two.

5818
03:53:23,439 --> 03:53:26,319
Yeah, they're going to get the barrier

5819
03:53:24,560 --> 03:53:27,520
out from Teddy does make it underneath

5820
03:53:26,319 --> 03:53:29,199
the turret. There is a nice little

5821
03:53:27,520 --> 03:53:31,520
bullet time to soften up hype

5822
03:53:29,199 --> 03:53:33,040
momentarily as the teleport will bring

5823
03:53:31,520 --> 03:53:34,800
back into the lane.

5824
03:53:33,040 --> 03:53:37,040
Still took a big chunk though. That's a

5825
03:53:34,800 --> 03:53:40,399
BF sword as well for Teddy. Obviously

5826
03:53:37,040 --> 03:53:41,680
building towards that BT. Uh no, and I

5827
03:53:40,399 --> 03:53:43,680
need to clarify. I'm not talking about

5828
03:53:41,680 --> 03:53:45,760
the first Transformer movie.

5829
03:53:43,680 --> 03:53:47,680
Oh, I'm talking about Transformer 1,

5830
03:53:45,760 --> 03:53:48,560
which is a separate animation film that

5831
03:53:47,680 --> 03:53:49,840
is really good.

5832
03:53:48,560 --> 03:53:51,120
Oh, yeah. With

5833
03:53:49,840 --> 03:53:51,359
I thought you were talking about Shy of

5834
03:53:51,120 --> 03:53:52,720
Boo.

5835
03:53:51,359 --> 03:53:54,800
No, no, no, no. I'm talking about like I

5836
03:53:52,720 --> 03:53:56,080
want to say Chris Hemsworth. Wonderful

5837
03:53:54,800 --> 03:53:56,720
film. Would highly recommend.

5838
03:53:56,080 --> 03:53:58,800
Oh, there you go.

5839
03:53:56,720 --> 03:54:01,120
Uh so again here, one of the big things

5840
03:53:58,800 --> 03:54:02,960
with Zenzo is that if you actually want

5841
03:54:01,120 --> 03:54:05,359
to kill him, you do have to commit. But

5842
03:54:02,960 --> 03:54:08,080
it means that both Sponge

5843
03:54:05,359 --> 03:54:10,800
and Yahoo flash over a wall while Annie

5844
03:54:08,080 --> 03:54:12,319
is just going completely unchecked. So

5845
03:54:10,800 --> 03:54:15,040
uh closer just gets multiple rotations

5846
03:54:12,319 --> 03:54:17,040
off. Tippers is burning. So I think they

5847
03:54:15,040 --> 03:54:19,680
just let I think you just take the hit.

5848
03:54:17,040 --> 03:54:21,760
Let Crocco flash and then don't try to

5849
03:54:19,680 --> 03:54:22,399
overchase as we have another fight on

5850
03:54:21,760 --> 03:54:24,080
our hands.

5851
03:54:22,399 --> 03:54:25,600
Yeah, another bear is ready to come out

5852
03:54:24,080 --> 03:54:28,239
as well. We're making it rain in the

5853
03:54:25,600 --> 03:54:30,399
river which is a little bit unnecessary.

5854
03:54:28,239 --> 03:54:31,920
It's already pretty wet. That's all

5855
03:54:30,399 --> 03:54:33,520
right. Flash comes in from closer.

5856
03:54:31,920 --> 03:54:35,600
throws down the bear, gets a brilliant

5857
03:54:33,520 --> 03:54:37,359
incinerate to make sure that Yahoo is

5858
03:54:35,600 --> 03:54:39,520
dead before he can really do anything.

5859
03:54:37,359 --> 03:54:41,120
Teddy now in trouble as the rockets are

5860
03:54:39,520 --> 03:54:43,439
raining

5861
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:45,359
and Hype is looking to chase them down.

5862
03:54:43,439 --> 03:54:47,120
The decoy not going to be doing any of

5863
03:54:45,359 --> 03:54:48,640
much as Teddy is going to spend his

5864
03:54:47,120 --> 03:54:51,120
first little stint in the death chamber

5865
03:54:48,640 --> 03:54:53,760
here after his trip back to the LCK

5866
03:54:51,120 --> 03:54:56,000
after 90 days. And now some more grubs

5867
03:54:53,760 --> 03:54:56,960
likely to go over to the Bros if they do

5868
03:54:56,000 --> 03:54:58,800
want to take them because they've

5869
03:54:56,960 --> 03:55:00,399
already gotten two. That is guaranteed

5870
03:54:58,800 --> 03:55:03,199
objective from that one. And if you were

5871
03:55:00,399 --> 03:55:05,439
expecting burn like us might be getting

5872
03:55:03,199 --> 03:55:07,760
a little little caught off guard as

5873
03:55:05,439 --> 03:55:09,040
closer, he was the only one from the

5874
03:55:07,760 --> 03:55:12,560
previous scrimmage that held on to his

5875
03:55:09,040 --> 03:55:16,080
flash just goes for the flash play,

5876
03:55:12,560 --> 03:55:17,920
finds two Andu and without that damage

5877
03:55:16,080 --> 03:55:20,319
of the Aurora, this fight is just over

5878
03:55:17,920 --> 03:55:22,319
before it begins. Nice chase there.

5879
03:55:20,319 --> 03:55:23,520
Proco even I think got a wind up auto on

5880
03:55:22,319 --> 03:55:25,760
the clone.

5881
03:55:23,520 --> 03:55:28,319
Oh, yeah. Beautifully done. this guy

5882
03:55:25,760 --> 03:55:30,720
right here. I also really love flash

5883
03:55:28,319 --> 03:55:32,399
incinerate instead of flash tibbers

5884
03:55:30,720 --> 03:55:34,800
because he only had those two targets

5885
03:55:32,399 --> 03:55:37,520
that he could go for. And then make sure

5886
03:55:34,800 --> 03:55:40,000
like guarantee that you get the CC down

5887
03:55:37,520 --> 03:55:41,840
and then throw a bear on top. You know,

5888
03:55:40,000 --> 03:55:44,080
you've already made sure that you've got

5889
03:55:41,840 --> 03:55:44,720
the CC and then you commit the big cool

5890
03:55:44,080 --> 03:55:47,760
down.

5891
03:55:44,720 --> 03:55:48,560
That's a 9minute malignance there for

5892
03:55:47,760 --> 03:55:49,840
Closer.

5893
03:55:48,560 --> 03:55:51,920
My goodness, we are going to be seeing

5894
03:55:49,840 --> 03:55:53,600
even more bears

5895
03:55:51,920 --> 03:55:55,920
having a pretty good time here. Here's

5896
03:55:53,600 --> 03:55:58,319
Closer in the mid lane as Paulo just

5897
03:55:55,920 --> 03:56:00,960
lying and wait allowing Closer to play

5898
03:55:58,319 --> 03:56:02,399
as aggressively as he would like.

5899
03:56:00,960 --> 03:56:03,920
There's a few other movies I watched on

5900
03:56:02,399 --> 03:56:06,160
the play but it's so hard to keep track.

5901
03:56:03,920 --> 03:56:07,439
I watch the accountant again.

5902
03:56:06,160 --> 03:56:09,520
Me and Valdez watched it.

5903
03:56:07,439 --> 03:56:10,239
Oh, the the accountant is like a really

5904
03:56:09,520 --> 03:56:11,199
good plane.

5905
03:56:10,239 --> 03:56:12,560
It's a great play.

5906
03:56:11,199 --> 03:56:12,960
Never watched that normally.

5907
03:56:12,560 --> 03:56:15,199
No,

5908
03:56:12,960 --> 03:56:16,080
but it's it's really good for planes.

5909
03:56:15,199 --> 03:56:17,520
I didn't know that there's an

5910
03:56:16,080 --> 03:56:19,359
accountant, too.

5911
03:56:17,520 --> 03:56:20,319
And I I learned that. I don't know. I

5912
03:56:19,359 --> 03:56:22,479
don't know whether I'm going to take

5913
03:56:20,319 --> 03:56:24,160
that risk now that I'm not in a plane.

5914
03:56:22,479 --> 03:56:26,160
No, no, no. You do that on a that

5915
03:56:24,160 --> 03:56:28,160
whenever your next plane is

5916
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:30,239
I feel like you know like the Denzel

5917
03:56:28,160 --> 03:56:31,840
Washington movie like the equalizer. I

5918
03:56:30,239 --> 03:56:33,680
feel like that would be an incredible

5919
03:56:31,840 --> 03:56:34,000
like series of films to watch on a plane

5920
03:56:33,680 --> 03:56:36,319
as well.

5921
03:56:34,000 --> 03:56:38,640
It would just watch watching him

5922
03:56:36,319 --> 03:56:40,399
revenging all over the place. Kind of

5923
03:56:38,640 --> 03:56:42,399
like Taken. I reckon Taken fits into

5924
03:56:40,399 --> 03:56:44,080
that sort of uh thing as well. And any

5925
03:56:42,399 --> 03:56:46,720
Jason Stathithm movie.

5926
03:56:44,080 --> 03:56:48,880
I am excited for the new Naked Gun

5927
03:56:46,720 --> 03:56:51,040
movie. Actually, I I I hope that they

5928
03:56:48,880 --> 03:56:53,120
I think Liam Niss might be able to do it

5929
03:56:51,040 --> 03:56:54,560
cuz it's hard cuz you're following up

5930
03:56:53,120 --> 03:56:56,800
after one of the greatest.

5931
03:56:54,560 --> 03:56:59,520
I mean, Leslie Nelson is probably one of

5932
03:56:56,800 --> 03:57:00,560
the funniest human beings to ever exist.

5933
03:56:59,520 --> 03:57:02,239
I'm with you.

5934
03:57:00,560 --> 03:57:05,600
And I don't even think like I'm not even

5935
03:57:02,239 --> 03:57:07,760
a huge Naked Gun fan. It's wrongfully

5936
03:57:05,600 --> 03:57:10,160
accused. If you haven't seen Wrongfully

5937
03:57:07,760 --> 03:57:13,680
Accused, just go and watch it. It is the

5938
03:57:10,160 --> 03:57:16,560
dumbest film to ever exist. And I almost

5939
03:57:13,680 --> 03:57:17,600
hurt myself laughing so much when I

5940
03:57:16,560 --> 03:57:18,399
watched it for the first time.

5941
03:57:17,600 --> 03:57:20,880
That's impressive.

5942
03:57:18,399 --> 03:57:23,359
It's extraordin I think it also holds up

5943
03:57:20,880 --> 03:57:26,479
because it's like it's very old, but

5944
03:57:23,359 --> 03:57:28,080
it's still just so absurd that it's f

5945
03:57:26,479 --> 03:57:29,120
it's it's brilliant. Absolutely

5946
03:57:28,080 --> 03:57:31,760
brilliant. If you haven't seen that one,

5947
03:57:29,120 --> 03:57:33,760
so your homework is watchfully accused

5948
03:57:31,760 --> 03:57:35,040
with Transformer 1.

5949
03:57:33,760 --> 03:57:36,560
Transformer 1.

5950
03:57:35,040 --> 03:57:37,600
Pacific Rim, but you've already seen

5951
03:57:36,560 --> 03:57:38,640
Pacific Rim. Let's be real.

5952
03:57:37,600 --> 03:57:39,439
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everyone's already

5953
03:57:38,640 --> 03:57:41,520
seen Pacific Rim.

5954
03:57:39,439 --> 03:57:43,120
And if not, just watch. Don't watch Two

5955
03:57:41,520 --> 03:57:44,640
by Mistake. Yeah, very important.

5956
03:57:43,120 --> 03:57:46,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, that doesn't exist.

5957
03:57:44,640 --> 03:57:48,960
That also didn't exist on the plane. I

5958
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:50,399
did, I admit, look for it cuz I was

5959
03:57:48,960 --> 03:57:51,520
like, "Wow, that was a great film. I

5960
03:57:50,399 --> 03:57:52,399
could just go and watch the second one

5961
03:57:51,520 --> 03:57:54,880
now."

5962
03:57:52,399 --> 03:57:56,399
Thankfully, didn't actually do that. Um,

5963
03:57:54,880 --> 03:57:58,239
but the other thing you got to do is

5964
03:57:56,399 --> 03:58:00,080
Ocarina of Rhyme. Make sure that you're

5965
03:57:58,239 --> 03:58:01,279
listening to some of that. Uh, some of

5966
03:58:00,080 --> 03:58:03,120
We are We are really

5967
03:58:01,279 --> 03:58:04,880
We got a lot of homework. There's a lot

5968
03:58:03,120 --> 03:58:07,040
to be done. uh don't do it now because

5969
03:58:04,880 --> 03:58:08,960
we have some video games that we are,

5970
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:11,840
you know, uh in in in the in the middle

5971
03:58:08,960 --> 03:58:14,399
of um that you you may not have realized

5972
03:58:11,840 --> 03:58:16,640
kind of like us. Uh yeah, Morgan

5973
03:58:14,399 --> 03:58:18,720
catching waves and you can see having a

5974
03:58:16,640 --> 03:58:21,680
look as far as the benefactors of all of

5975
03:58:18,720 --> 03:58:24,000
this has been hyping closer. It's where

5976
03:58:21,680 --> 03:58:26,080
all the money has gone. It feels pretty

5977
03:58:24,000 --> 03:58:28,319
good

5978
03:58:26,080 --> 03:58:30,960
and it makes these fights hard to play

5979
03:58:28,319 --> 03:58:34,080
out as well because you need to ensure

5980
03:58:30,960 --> 03:58:36,640
that this and he is taken out uh

5981
03:58:34,080 --> 03:58:39,120
basically immediately

5982
03:58:36,640 --> 03:58:41,600
otherwise you are going to be in a very

5983
03:58:39,120 --> 03:58:42,800
very tough position. The amount of

5984
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:44,640
damage that close is going to be able to

5985
03:58:42,800 --> 03:58:45,520
do is a big deal. The the lead isn't

5986
03:58:44,640 --> 03:58:47,600
that crazy though.

5987
03:58:45,520 --> 03:58:49,439
I just remembered another film. Do you

5988
03:58:47,600 --> 03:58:51,359
like Dracula movies?

5989
03:58:49,439 --> 03:58:53,120
Uh sure. We actually went and watched

5990
03:58:51,359 --> 03:58:54,399
Noseratu together, didn't we? We did.

5991
03:58:53,120 --> 03:58:55,680
Another one that might be a little bit

5992
03:58:54,399 --> 03:58:57,359
more serious. Is this as serious as

5993
03:58:55,680 --> 03:58:58,399
well? Yahoo. Taking a bit more serious

5994
03:58:57,359 --> 03:59:00,720
than Noseratu.

5995
03:58:58,399 --> 03:59:03,680
Yeah, a little bit more serious is uh

5996
03:59:00,720 --> 03:59:05,120
Dracula Dead and Loving It. Another

5997
03:59:03,680 --> 03:59:06,960
Leslie Nelson film.

5998
03:59:05,120 --> 03:59:09,040
Does not you should definitely watch

5999
03:59:06,960 --> 03:59:12,000
like most serious Atlas.

6000
03:59:09,040 --> 03:59:15,199
Very good. very probably the best and

6001
03:59:12,000 --> 03:59:18,080
most uh historically accurate um

6002
03:59:15,199 --> 03:59:19,840
they really are just kind of running

6003
03:59:18,080 --> 03:59:20,479
away with the game uh right in front of

6004
03:59:19,840 --> 03:59:22,479
our eyes.

6005
03:59:20,479 --> 03:59:23,680
They really are. Hype doing a great job

6006
03:59:22,479 --> 03:59:24,960
here towards the bottom side really

6007
03:59:23,680 --> 03:59:28,560
putting that Trinity Force through its

6008
03:59:24,960 --> 03:59:31,760
paces. 35 health on Tibers still

6009
03:59:28,560 --> 03:59:33,040
pushing. Look at that denial of 50 gold.

6010
03:59:31,760 --> 03:59:36,319
Never mind. He's just going to give the

6011
03:59:33,040 --> 03:59:38,720
50 gold over to Yahoo. That's crazy,

6012
03:59:36,319 --> 03:59:41,520
man.

6013
03:59:38,720 --> 03:59:43,359
Okay. Well, he did that. That's just to

6014
03:59:41,520 --> 03:59:43,680
try and deter him from stopping the

6015
03:59:43,359 --> 03:59:45,040
back.

6016
03:59:43,680 --> 03:59:46,479
Oh, you know what else I watched? What

6017
03:59:45,040 --> 03:59:47,760
did you Mia?

6018
03:59:46,479 --> 03:59:48,880
Oh, wow.

6019
03:59:47,760 --> 03:59:50,080
Yeah,

6020
03:59:48,880 --> 03:59:52,000
I don't know whether I'd advocate for

6021
03:59:50,080 --> 03:59:54,160
that one necessarily. Although,

6022
03:59:52,000 --> 03:59:55,520
do you know what? The vibes were great.

6023
03:59:54,160 --> 03:59:57,680
Yeah, that's the thing. And I actually

6024
03:59:55,520 --> 03:59:59,359
heard that the vibes on set were also

6025
03:59:57,680 --> 04:00:00,640
great cuz like I think it was like an

6026
03:59:59,359 --> 04:00:01,920
interview with Pierce Broman that I

6027
04:00:00,640 --> 04:00:02,560
watched at some point where like

6028
04:00:01,920 --> 04:00:04,000
my favorite

6029
04:00:02,560 --> 04:00:05,760
him and the other singer.

6030
04:00:04,000 --> 04:00:07,279
Yeah, him and the other guys are just

6031
04:00:05,760 --> 04:00:09,439
like, "Oh, we were just having a good

6032
04:00:07,279 --> 04:00:10,880
time. We just got to be bimbos. That he

6033
04:00:09,439 --> 04:00:11,760
literally said that. It was just

6034
04:00:10,880 --> 04:00:13,920
I'm not surprised.

6035
04:00:11,760 --> 04:00:15,359
It's just brilliant. And so I think I

6036
04:00:13,920 --> 04:00:17,680
could watch that movie and be even

6037
04:00:15,359 --> 04:00:18,160
happier watching it this time without

6038
04:00:17,680 --> 04:00:19,760
context.

6039
04:00:18,160 --> 04:00:22,080
Knowing that everyone is actually just

6040
04:00:19,760 --> 04:00:24,399
vibing. They're not just

6041
04:00:22,080 --> 04:00:25,359
brilliant. All right, Teddy taking a

6042
04:00:24,399 --> 04:00:27,920
little bit of damage here in the mid

6043
04:00:25,359 --> 04:00:30,479
lane as Polo being a bodyguard to hype.

6044
04:00:27,920 --> 04:00:31,920
Just doing so much work,

6045
04:00:30,479 --> 04:00:33,520
man. Maybe that's a rewatch. That could

6046
04:00:31,920 --> 04:00:35,199
be a rewatch coming up. It's just it's

6047
04:00:33,520 --> 04:00:37,279
just fun, right? You just know you're

6048
04:00:35,199 --> 04:00:39,199
going to have a good time.

6049
04:00:37,279 --> 04:00:40,720
And all right, Polo getting some deep

6050
04:00:39,199 --> 04:00:42,080
vision down. Don't really have too much

6051
04:00:40,720 --> 04:00:44,720
to fight for outside of this Herald

6052
04:00:42,080 --> 04:00:46,239
that's coming up in 10 seconds time. And

6053
04:00:44,720 --> 04:00:47,600
Sponge. Oh dear, that's two for the

6054
04:00:46,239 --> 04:00:49,040
price of one on that pulverized. But the

6055
04:00:47,600 --> 04:00:50,800
cyclone is going to return the favor.

6056
04:00:49,040 --> 04:00:53,600
But never mind. There are just too many

6057
04:00:50,800 --> 04:00:56,000
bros and just not enough TRX in this

6058
04:00:53,600 --> 04:00:58,399
area. Although Sponge is lasting a long

6059
04:00:56,000 --> 04:01:00,640
time. And And he will just send them

6060
04:00:58,399 --> 04:01:02,239
back home. But that is a big cool down

6061
04:01:00,640 --> 04:01:03,920
that they will not have to stop this

6062
04:01:02,239 --> 04:01:05,680
herald from going down. So Shelly will

6063
04:01:03,920 --> 04:01:07,359
belong to the Bros. There's nothing that

6064
04:01:05,680 --> 04:01:09,359
DRX can do about it.

6065
04:01:07,359 --> 04:01:10,960
I kind of want to see a replay. How did

6066
04:01:09,359 --> 04:01:12,560
Sponge get so desync from the rest of

6067
04:01:10,960 --> 04:01:14,640
his team? I feel like the Chase lost it

6068
04:01:12,560 --> 04:01:16,239
forever. It feels like the rest of his

6069
04:01:14,640 --> 04:01:17,359
team just either he was too far forward

6070
04:01:16,239 --> 04:01:19,120
or the rest of his team should have been

6071
04:01:17,359 --> 04:01:20,880
there to back him up earlier because you

6072
04:01:19,120 --> 04:01:25,680
know that Herold is going to be the main

6073
04:01:20,880 --> 04:01:27,199
objective on the minds of the Bros.

6074
04:01:25,680 --> 04:01:29,040
All right, Crocker just will be taking

6075
04:01:27,199 --> 04:01:31,439
that one down.

6076
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:33,279
That was enough. keepers verdict a very

6077
04:01:31,439 --> 04:01:34,800
big tool actually for DRX in this

6078
04:01:33,279 --> 04:01:36,880
composition and as soon as that ends

6079
04:01:34,800 --> 04:01:39,199
cyclone are down what else are you going

6080
04:01:36,880 --> 04:01:41,600
to do you know it's just not a whole lot

6081
04:01:39,199 --> 04:01:43,199
of options that you will have and

6082
04:01:41,600 --> 04:01:44,800
composition from ahead just seems

6083
04:01:43,199 --> 04:01:46,399
impossible to play into as well

6084
04:01:44,800 --> 04:01:48,080
it's it's really I I think either of

6085
04:01:46,399 --> 04:01:49,760
these comps if you get a lead because

6086
04:01:48,080 --> 04:01:51,600
there are so short range we we talk

6087
04:01:49,760 --> 04:01:54,160
about this a lot I think at least for

6088
04:01:51,600 --> 04:01:57,520
bro you have some combat mechanics in

6089
04:01:54,160 --> 04:02:00,000
the raw power of your front line as you

6090
04:01:57,520 --> 04:02:01,760
get later into the game for DRX I don't

6091
04:02:00,000 --> 04:02:03,760
really think that's the case.

6092
04:02:01,760 --> 04:02:05,120
Yeah, outside of like a great old from

6093
04:02:03,760 --> 04:02:06,640
Undeil, you can't always create a

6094
04:02:05,120 --> 04:02:09,120
numbers advantage. So, that's something,

6095
04:02:06,640 --> 04:02:10,479
but there's a bit of a tough situation

6096
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:12,560
and they're probably going to have to

6097
04:02:10,479 --> 04:02:14,640
fight. They don't want to give over too

6098
04:02:12,560 --> 04:02:16,560
many dragons. Thing that I'm loving is

6099
04:02:14,640 --> 04:02:17,680
that they're keeping up the pressure as

6100
04:02:16,560 --> 04:02:18,960
maybe this is a bridge too fast.

6101
04:02:17,680 --> 04:02:20,319
Deadpass presence. He's going to be able

6102
04:02:18,960 --> 04:02:23,439
to pull Crocco away. He does have to

6103
04:02:20,319 --> 04:02:25,120
flash, but now Morgan makes his way in

6104
04:02:23,439 --> 04:02:26,800
and he is a bit of a monster. Rich is

6105
04:02:25,120 --> 04:02:28,000
dashing around but not able to find too

6106
04:02:26,800 --> 04:02:30,239
much of an angle. And this was all

6107
04:02:28,000 --> 04:02:33,120
without closer. Now he turns up. Bear at

6108
04:02:30,239 --> 04:02:36,000
the ready and the bros are ready to team

6109
04:02:33,120 --> 04:02:37,840
fight. There is no cyclone and that

6110
04:02:36,000 --> 04:02:40,800
keeper's verdict is still a little while

6111
04:02:37,840 --> 04:02:42,000
away these early levels.

6112
04:02:40,800 --> 04:02:44,479
So they do have to be a little bit

6113
04:02:42,000 --> 04:02:46,000
careful. There's the flash in. They look

6114
04:02:44,479 --> 04:02:48,160
for the angle on ridge. He does flash

6115
04:02:46,000 --> 04:02:51,439
himself away as Yahoo going to be able

6116
04:02:48,160 --> 04:02:52,560
to buy some space between worlds. DRX

6117
04:02:51,439 --> 04:02:54,080
though still not quite able to get

6118
04:02:52,560 --> 04:02:56,160
themselves in there. Step presence is

6119
04:02:54,080 --> 04:02:58,720
good. Bullet time even better to soften

6120
04:02:56,160 --> 04:03:00,399
up the cow. And once again, Tibis is

6121
04:02:58,720 --> 04:03:03,120
going to donate 50 gold this time over

6122
04:03:00,399 --> 04:03:04,479
to Rich. In goes, can he find it? Yes,

6123
04:03:03,120 --> 04:03:06,800
he just gets headbutted out though as

6124
04:03:04,479 --> 04:03:09,520
Polo will get slammed into the wall. And

6125
04:03:06,800 --> 04:03:12,880
Bro just kind of playing with their food

6126
04:03:09,520 --> 04:03:15,439
for so long that the food bit back.

6127
04:03:12,880 --> 04:03:19,359
I want your food to bite you. But

6128
04:03:15,439 --> 04:03:21,199
somehow bro on the receiving end of that

6129
04:03:19,359 --> 04:03:23,520
as it felt like they had a lot of

6130
04:03:21,199 --> 04:03:25,840
windows there to actually commit but

6131
04:03:23,520 --> 04:03:29,279
kind of keep kept going for these half

6132
04:03:25,840 --> 04:03:33,680
engages and DRX shrug off a lot of that

6133
04:03:29,279 --> 04:03:35,600
damage as we take uh

6134
04:03:33,680 --> 04:03:38,479
okay I thought we were going to get into

6135
04:03:35,600 --> 04:03:40,720
we take the river take a look

6136
04:03:38,479 --> 04:03:42,160
as the timing is a little better to just

6137
04:03:40,720 --> 04:03:44,720
kill rich and that should be the end of

6138
04:03:42,160 --> 04:03:46,880
it but it's this overextension into

6139
04:03:44,720 --> 04:03:48,479
Teddy when he or into on rider when

6140
04:03:46,880 --> 04:03:50,800
Teddy is completely safe. That kind of

6141
04:03:48,479 --> 04:03:53,680
ends up cooking them cuz it means Paulo

6142
04:03:50,800 --> 04:03:56,479
and He are both taken relatively low.

6143
04:03:53,680 --> 04:03:59,040
Then Paulo has to use his that times out

6144
04:03:56,479 --> 04:04:02,239
and they just they get the cyclone and

6145
04:03:59,040 --> 04:04:04,000
the keeper's verdict. Back off cool down

6146
04:04:02,239 --> 04:04:06,000
and they have them exactly when they

6147
04:04:04,000 --> 04:04:07,920
need them.

6148
04:04:06,000 --> 04:04:10,080
And it's a big win for DRX. Gets them

6149
04:04:07,920 --> 04:04:12,560
the dragon. Get them a kill as well and

6150
04:04:10,080 --> 04:04:14,880
ensure that this game. We know this is a

6151
04:04:12,560 --> 04:04:17,359
free gamer though, right? So,

6152
04:04:14,880 --> 04:04:20,960
uh, every game this year between these

6153
04:04:17,359 --> 04:04:22,640
two teams, I think has been, uh, free as

6154
04:04:20,960 --> 04:04:24,319
riching Morgan.

6155
04:04:22,640 --> 04:04:25,840
Well, once he has cleaver, I think he

6156
04:04:24,319 --> 04:04:27,520
actually does kind of cook him. He does

6157
04:04:25,840 --> 04:04:29,040
still does a good amount of damage, but

6158
04:04:27,520 --> 04:04:30,319
actually killing him, I think, is still

6159
04:04:29,040 --> 04:04:32,000
something else entirely.

6160
04:04:30,319 --> 04:04:34,640
Yeah, Rich given the good old thumbs up

6161
04:04:32,000 --> 04:04:37,120
there as he was at least got to do some

6162
04:04:34,640 --> 04:04:38,399
exercise as he wandered down the lane.

6163
04:04:37,120 --> 04:04:41,120
Morgan just going to be able to catch

6164
04:04:38,399 --> 04:04:42,880
this. Shouldn't be too much of a worry.

6165
04:04:41,120 --> 04:04:45,120
But if that is how the bros are going to

6166
04:04:42,880 --> 04:04:46,720
be out are going to be piloting these

6167
04:04:45,120 --> 04:04:48,160
team fights, could be a little bit of a

6168
04:04:46,720 --> 04:04:50,160
worry because that was some

6169
04:04:48,160 --> 04:04:52,399
indecisiveness. Crocco also deciding to

6170
04:04:50,160 --> 04:04:54,239
go into the one guy that you know has a

6171
04:04:52,399 --> 04:04:56,160
very good answer for Adacious Charge is

6172
04:04:54,239 --> 04:04:57,439
not exactly optimal. So they're going to

6173
04:04:56,160 --> 04:05:00,080
have to turn that one around if they

6174
04:04:57,439 --> 04:05:02,080
want to make something happen here as

6175
04:05:00,080 --> 04:05:04,239
hype does hit that two item spike. Man,

6176
04:05:02,080 --> 04:05:07,359
that is a very accelerated cork th000

6177
04:05:04,239 --> 04:05:09,840
gold in the lead against Teddy for now.

6178
04:05:07,359 --> 04:05:12,800
And it looks even worse because it's one

6179
04:05:09,840 --> 04:05:15,199
item and you know two little swords

6180
04:05:12,800 --> 04:05:16,960
against the uh manam imammune and the

6181
04:05:15,199 --> 04:05:19,199
trinity force already completed here for

6182
04:05:16,960 --> 04:05:21,199
hype does have both of his summoners

6183
04:05:19,199 --> 04:05:24,960
now. So this corki going to be a big

6184
04:05:21,199 --> 04:05:26,640
part of any fights that are coming up

6185
04:05:24,960 --> 04:05:28,319
and I think the teams have shut us up

6186
04:05:26,640 --> 04:05:30,080
chronicler I don't think it's time to be

6187
04:05:28,319 --> 04:05:32,000
talking about Leslie Nelson movies right

6188
04:05:30,080 --> 04:05:33,359
now. Well I mean right now we definitely

6189
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:35,199
can cuz there's not going to be a fight

6190
04:05:33,359 --> 04:05:38,800
for the next 3 minutes. Yeah, but I mean

6191
04:05:35,199 --> 04:05:40,560
there's stake to be set. Stakes stake

6192
04:05:38,800 --> 04:05:42,479
setting.

6193
04:05:40,560 --> 04:05:44,880
Still that's just another reference to

6194
04:05:42,479 --> 04:05:46,160
the vampire movie, my man. I I'm just

6195
04:05:44,880 --> 04:05:47,359
saying.

6196
04:05:46,160 --> 04:05:48,000
Damn, he got me.

6197
04:05:47,359 --> 04:05:49,920
Yeah,

6198
04:05:48,000 --> 04:05:50,640
I haven't I haven't thought about that

6199
04:05:49,920 --> 04:05:52,080
one by me.

6200
04:05:50,640 --> 04:05:54,160
I honestly haven't thought about dead

6201
04:05:52,080 --> 04:05:55,680
and loving it for such a long time. I

6202
04:05:54,160 --> 04:05:57,279
really need to watch that again.

6203
04:05:55,680 --> 04:05:58,720
I love how you frame it as well as a

6204
04:05:57,279 --> 04:06:02,000
more serious vampire movie than

6205
04:05:58,720 --> 04:06:04,239
Noseradu, which was as realistic as a

6206
04:06:02,000 --> 04:06:04,880
vampire movie really could be. It's very

6207
04:06:04,239 --> 04:06:06,720
true.

6208
04:06:04,880 --> 04:06:09,439
Well, we are just starting Oticon.

6209
04:06:06,720 --> 04:06:11,279
Okay, bro. This is never not working.

6210
04:06:09,439 --> 04:06:13,359
We are proactive here today.

6211
04:06:11,279 --> 04:06:15,199
Uh-huh. Clos are going to get a little

6212
04:06:13,359 --> 04:06:16,800
bit of cannon gold and then move on

6213
04:06:15,199 --> 04:06:17,279
back. We are backing away from the

6214
04:06:16,800 --> 04:06:18,560
Articon.

6215
04:06:17,279 --> 04:06:21,920
That is a good call. I don't think we

6216
04:06:18,560 --> 04:06:23,760
should be doing Artacon into the um MF

6217
04:06:21,920 --> 04:06:26,239
Wukong and Aurora. I feel like that's

6218
04:06:23,760 --> 04:06:27,359
not a good call. And they don't. So, I

6219
04:06:26,239 --> 04:06:29,359
I'm loving that.

6220
04:06:27,359 --> 04:06:30,160
Yeah. All right. Well, Yahoo is just

6221
04:06:29,359 --> 04:06:34,319
going to be able to clear out some

6222
04:06:30,160 --> 04:06:36,560
vision. Mhm. So, some resets will ensue.

6223
04:06:34,319 --> 04:06:38,399
Not too much to worry about. So, keeping

6224
04:06:36,560 --> 04:06:40,160
it within touching distance, our DRX,

6225
04:06:38,399 --> 04:06:41,840
it's under a 2,000 gold lead, at least

6226
04:06:40,160 --> 04:06:43,760
for the moment. And here at 21 minutes,

6227
04:06:41,840 --> 04:06:45,840
that is not too much of a big deal. They

6228
04:06:43,760 --> 04:06:48,399
also have that extra dragon. It's a

6229
04:06:45,840 --> 04:06:49,840
chem. Um, of course, orcs not working

6230
04:06:48,399 --> 04:06:51,840
today, so not paying too much attention.

6231
04:06:49,840 --> 04:06:52,319
We did get a chem soul in our last game

6232
04:06:51,840 --> 04:06:53,760
as well.

6233
04:06:52,319 --> 04:06:56,560
When we was paying attention, we got

6234
04:06:53,760 --> 04:06:57,680
like 15 mountains, so I I'm glad that at

6235
04:06:56,560 --> 04:06:59,920
least a little bit.

6236
04:06:57,680 --> 04:07:02,479
The mega mountain day was odd. There was

6237
04:06:59,920 --> 04:07:03,920
no Oh, it it carried over. I think there

6238
04:07:02,479 --> 04:07:05,439
extra mountain as well.

6239
04:07:03,920 --> 04:07:06,880
Yeah. Yeah. Like two or three more. It

6240
04:07:05,439 --> 04:07:08,800
was crazy. Damn, that's weird.

6241
04:07:06,880 --> 04:07:10,399
I know. It was. We've never really been

6242
04:07:08,800 --> 04:07:13,040
inundated with mountains. It's only ever

6243
04:07:10,399 --> 04:07:16,720
been chemex and clouds.

6244
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:19,040
All right. And his really got a good W

6245
04:07:16,720 --> 04:07:22,960
finger. He just knows when to press that

6246
04:07:19,040 --> 04:07:25,040
button. But bro also really like using

6247
04:07:22,960 --> 04:07:26,800
all of their dashing abilities into the

6248
04:07:25,040 --> 04:07:29,120
Poppy,

6249
04:07:26,800 --> 04:07:31,199
which you you know I ideally you

6250
04:07:29,120 --> 04:07:32,800
wouldn't do, but he is the one that has

6251
04:07:31,199 --> 04:07:34,479
to face check, right? He is the target

6252
04:07:32,800 --> 04:07:36,880
that's being presented the majority of

6253
04:07:34,479 --> 04:07:38,880
the time. So very very good that he can

6254
04:07:36,880 --> 04:07:40,479
just press W when he needs to.

6255
04:07:38,880 --> 04:07:42,560
Tier

6256
04:07:40,479 --> 04:07:44,720
for Hype still not fully uh fully

6257
04:07:42,560 --> 04:07:47,600
stacked. Only has a few left to go.

6258
04:07:44,720 --> 04:07:50,640
Imagine he's running around asking my my

6259
04:07:47,600 --> 04:07:52,319
kingdom for a tier. Yeah, please let me

6260
04:07:50,640 --> 04:07:54,560
hit some stuff. He's got a last whisper

6261
04:07:52,319 --> 04:07:56,720
now as well. My goodness. This uh Corki

6262
04:07:54,560 --> 04:07:58,319
pretty accelerated. Same thing can be

6263
04:07:56,720 --> 04:08:01,359
said for Teddy, but he doesn't have the

6264
04:07:58,319 --> 04:08:03,439
extra item that has been put up here for

6265
04:08:01,359 --> 04:08:04,960
hype.

6266
04:08:03,439 --> 04:08:06,960
Can't believe you just I I I'm really

6267
04:08:04,960 --> 04:08:07,359
trying to get you off the rails again.

6268
04:08:06,960 --> 04:08:08,880
My

6269
04:08:07,359 --> 04:08:12,080
Oh, no. I'm I'm locked back.

6270
04:08:08,880 --> 04:08:13,680
My kingdom for a tier. Come on, Atlas.

6271
04:08:12,080 --> 04:08:15,120
So obvious.

6272
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:17,680
What do you mean? Oh, tears of the

6273
04:08:15,120 --> 04:08:19,680
kingdom. Aha, I'm there with you now.

6274
04:08:17,680 --> 04:08:20,720
But no, it's too late. I don't want to

6275
04:08:19,680 --> 04:08:22,080
talk about it anymore.

6276
04:08:20,720 --> 04:08:23,680
You said you said kingdom. I was

6277
04:08:22,080 --> 04:08:24,479
thinking of Kingdom of Heaven. You

6278
04:08:23,680 --> 04:08:26,160
remember that? Um

6279
04:08:24,479 --> 04:08:28,080
I do remember that movie. That's where

6280
04:08:26,160 --> 04:08:31,439
the meme comes from, right? Like the the

6281
04:08:28,080 --> 04:08:34,399
guy going like what Duro did the maybe

6282
04:08:31,439 --> 04:08:36,319
to shut up. I'm pretty sure it is.

6283
04:08:34,399 --> 04:08:39,680
Edward Norton in the surprise role that

6284
04:08:36,319 --> 04:08:40,720
no one knew it was him perhaps. I don't

6285
04:08:39,680 --> 04:08:43,120
quite remember.

6286
04:08:40,720 --> 04:08:44,479
Maybe. I do remember Duro doing that,

6287
04:08:43,120 --> 04:08:44,960
but I thought that that was more just a

6288
04:08:44,479 --> 04:08:46,399
Duro thing.

6289
04:08:44,960 --> 04:08:48,880
Oh no. I think it was just a doro thing,

6290
04:08:46,399 --> 04:08:51,680
but I know it's also a me as a drake

6291
04:08:48,880 --> 04:08:53,600
gets taken and we go two to two. Yeah.

6292
04:08:51,680 --> 04:08:55,600
So, it's evening out the dragons. We're

6293
04:08:53,600 --> 04:08:58,000
making sure that we get as many chem as

6294
04:08:55,600 --> 04:08:59,760
we possibly can have.

6295
04:08:58,000 --> 04:09:02,800
So, there are, you know, there's the

6296
04:08:59,760 --> 04:09:05,520
possibility of another three we can lock

6297
04:09:02,800 --> 04:09:07,199
in for everyone. And's going to turn up

6298
04:09:05,520 --> 04:09:09,600
towards his top side. Decides not to

6299
04:09:07,199 --> 04:09:11,760
give his position away as still a

6300
04:09:09,600 --> 04:09:13,439
target. Still something that they're all

6301
04:09:11,760 --> 04:09:15,040
going to have to consider. 1,000 gold as

6302
04:09:13,439 --> 04:09:17,760
a lead for Bro means basically nothing

6303
04:09:15,040 --> 04:09:19,439
at this stage. And oh my goodness, like

6304
04:09:17,760 --> 04:09:21,359
how many five more stacks something

6305
04:09:19,439 --> 04:09:24,080
there? There it is. Hype manages to lock

6306
04:09:21,359 --> 04:09:25,199
it down. Minds a few cheeky autos.

6307
04:09:24,080 --> 04:09:27,040
That's going to be able to get that

6308
04:09:25,199 --> 04:09:30,239
evolution. A lot of extra damage now

6309
04:09:27,040 --> 04:09:32,479
available here for the Corki as Morgan

6310
04:09:30,239 --> 04:09:33,920
is just getting hit by Rich. Man, it

6311
04:09:32,479 --> 04:09:36,080
just takes a lot of effort, doesn't it,

6312
04:09:33,920 --> 04:09:37,680
to get through this scion. Yeah, he's

6313
04:09:36,080 --> 04:09:39,520
he's definitely will be able to now in

6314
04:09:37,680 --> 04:09:41,760
the long run because he has Eclipse as

6315
04:09:39,520 --> 04:09:43,040
well as cleaver as bro. I think they're

6316
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:44,800
just going to keep doing these fake outs

6317
04:09:43,040 --> 04:09:45,279
and keep seeing if the BRX response is

6318
04:09:44,800 --> 04:09:46,319
good.

6319
04:09:45,279 --> 04:09:48,160
Yeah,

6320
04:09:46,319 --> 04:09:51,199
maybe they I think he back off if they

6321
04:09:48,160 --> 04:09:53,760
if Rich TPS cuz obviously Morgan can

6322
04:09:51,199 --> 04:09:55,760
join with his but now they've stalled

6323
04:09:53,760 --> 04:09:57,120
for so I think they can just take this.

6324
04:09:55,760 --> 04:09:58,640
Well, the teleport is going to come in

6325
04:09:57,120 --> 04:10:00,640
but it feels a little bit late here.

6326
04:09:58,640 --> 04:10:02,640
Crocco in perfect position to rotate

6327
04:10:00,640 --> 04:10:04,319
over from Sponge. But they're holding on

6328
04:10:02,640 --> 04:10:05,600
to him. They do want to be able to burst

6329
04:10:04,319 --> 04:10:07,120
this one down. And Crocco is almost

6330
04:10:05,600 --> 04:10:09,520
dead. The public execution comes down,

6331
04:10:07,120 --> 04:10:11,439
but it misses and the cyclone comes in.

6332
04:10:09,520 --> 04:10:13,359
The knockups are good, but that one's

6333
04:10:11,439 --> 04:10:14,880
even better as the bullet time does help

6334
04:10:13,359 --> 04:10:18,160
secure the kill onto the jungler. And

6335
04:10:14,880 --> 04:10:20,000
there is the steel. DRX, they managed to

6336
04:10:18,160 --> 04:10:21,279
deny the Bros. And the Bros just wanting

6337
04:10:20,000 --> 04:10:22,720
to get themselves out of here. Poly

6338
04:10:21,279 --> 04:10:24,720
decides instead though that he wants to

6339
04:10:22,720 --> 04:10:26,239
go back in. And perhaps to get

6340
04:10:24,720 --> 04:10:28,160
themselves out of there was a better

6341
04:10:26,239 --> 04:10:30,239
choice as down goes the Annie as well.

6342
04:10:28,160 --> 04:10:32,000
Morgan and Hype just wondering what the

6343
04:10:30,239 --> 04:10:35,199
heck just happened because it all went

6344
04:10:32,000 --> 04:10:37,040
wrong. Bit of a split call there for

6345
04:10:35,199 --> 04:10:39,760
Bro. I think you can fully commit to the

6346
04:10:37,040 --> 04:10:41,760
team fight, make it work, or you can

6347
04:10:39,760 --> 04:10:44,560
fully commit to taking out a you can

6348
04:10:41,760 --> 04:10:47,359
make that work. Instead, they kind of do

6349
04:10:44,560 --> 04:10:49,359
both. And as a result, neither because I

6350
04:10:47,359 --> 04:10:50,880
want you to look. Crocco is up. Crocco,

6351
04:10:49,359 --> 04:10:53,359
my man, you don't have resistances. You

6352
04:10:50,880 --> 04:10:54,880
can't do that. Has to maybe wouldn't

6353
04:10:53,359 --> 04:10:56,399
have gotten hit, but I think the flash

6354
04:10:54,880 --> 04:10:58,800
makes sense cuz if Rich hits you, you do

6355
04:10:56,399 --> 04:11:00,160
end up dying. And then Rich is in the

6356
04:10:58,800 --> 04:11:02,479
back line. He can obviously deal with

6357
04:11:00,160 --> 04:11:05,120
these people.

6358
04:11:02,479 --> 04:11:07,199
But this all comes down to them being

6359
04:11:05,120 --> 04:11:08,000
completely shredded unnecessarily.

6360
04:11:07,199 --> 04:11:10,720
Atlas.

6361
04:11:08,000 --> 04:11:12,399
Yeah. And Paulo like going back in

6362
04:11:10,720 --> 04:11:14,239
because he knew that he was dead. But

6363
04:11:12,399 --> 04:11:15,760
you could see like a little bit of

6364
04:11:14,239 --> 04:11:17,680
movement there from closer to get back

6365
04:11:15,760 --> 04:11:20,399
in as well. I think he was probably also

6366
04:11:17,680 --> 04:11:22,239
guaranteed dead. But DRX, they just find

6367
04:11:20,399 --> 04:11:24,319
their way in, bro. Open the door. And

6368
04:11:22,239 --> 04:11:26,239
DRX say why. Thank you.

6369
04:11:24,319 --> 04:11:26,720
Teddy, I think his ults have been on

6370
04:11:26,239 --> 04:11:27,760
point.

6371
04:11:26,720 --> 04:11:30,160
Yeah, really good.

6372
04:11:27,760 --> 04:11:31,760
Actually been having a good impact here.

6373
04:11:30,160 --> 04:11:33,279
It's been a good champion for him in in

6374
04:11:31,760 --> 04:11:34,720
his career as well to this Fortune. It's

6375
04:11:33,279 --> 04:11:38,560
always He's always been one of these

6376
04:11:34,720 --> 04:11:40,800
guys that we do tend to trust on it.

6377
04:11:38,560 --> 04:11:42,800
So, good to see that he still has the

6378
04:11:40,800 --> 04:11:44,800
angles.

6379
04:11:42,800 --> 04:11:46,399
And now we've got a very honest game of

6380
04:11:44,800 --> 04:11:47,760
League of Legends on our hands. But from

6381
04:11:46,399 --> 04:11:49,279
the other direction, right, we were

6382
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:51,040
talking about Alfro have the slight

6383
04:11:49,279 --> 04:11:52,720
lead. Now it's TRX that have the slight

6384
04:11:51,040 --> 04:11:54,960
lead, but they also have Articon buff on

6385
04:11:52,720 --> 04:11:56,640
top of it as Sponge is taking some

6386
04:11:54,960 --> 04:11:58,560
damage from Crocco. Crocco is just

6387
04:11:56,640 --> 04:12:02,319
looking for his way through.

6388
04:11:58,560 --> 04:12:04,399
Blast will get spun out to safety.

6389
04:12:02,319 --> 04:12:07,439
It's not about what you fight for, it's

6390
04:12:04,399 --> 04:12:08,960
about fighting.

6391
04:12:07,439 --> 04:12:10,640
I've never heard that said about bro

6392
04:12:08,960 --> 04:12:12,479
ever before. Atlas,

6393
04:12:10,640 --> 04:12:13,760
we are we are I I was a little worried

6394
04:12:12,479 --> 04:12:15,840
with the start, but we are currently

6395
04:12:13,760 --> 04:12:16,800
sitting at nine kills at 26 and 1/2

6396
04:12:15,840 --> 04:12:18,560
minutes. So,

6397
04:12:16,800 --> 04:12:20,560
it's not exactly the most bloodthirsty.

6398
04:12:18,560 --> 04:12:22,720
It feels more action-packed than it

6399
04:12:20,560 --> 04:12:26,000
otherwise could be, though.

6400
04:12:22,720 --> 04:12:27,359
like DRX the obviously they've already

6401
04:12:26,000 --> 04:12:29,120
got themselves back into a golden but

6402
04:12:27,359 --> 04:12:30,319
even if they were down like one 2k gold

6403
04:12:29,120 --> 04:12:31,520
at this point I don't think it matters I

6404
04:12:30,319 --> 04:12:32,880
think it's just going to be the fights

6405
04:12:31,520 --> 04:12:35,760
cuz what's going to happen in either of

6406
04:12:32,880 --> 04:12:38,080
these fights is a team is going to fully

6407
04:12:35,760 --> 04:12:40,160
blow all their cooldowns on a member

6408
04:12:38,080 --> 04:12:41,199
whether they die or you overextend and

6409
04:12:40,160 --> 04:12:43,600
lose

6410
04:12:41,199 --> 04:12:45,439
as that CP is a dead giveaway that this

6411
04:12:43,600 --> 04:12:47,040
is happening

6412
04:12:45,439 --> 04:12:49,359
well there are a lot of pings in the

6413
04:12:47,040 --> 04:12:52,479
area here for DRX's going to walk over

6414
04:12:49,359 --> 04:12:54,319
this ward and find things out as the

6415
04:12:52,479 --> 04:12:55,680
Baron's down to 50%. It's not exactly a

6416
04:12:54,319 --> 04:12:56,880
massive amount, but Andal, remember,

6417
04:12:55,680 --> 04:12:58,720
does have to keep his verdict.

6418
04:12:56,880 --> 04:13:00,800
They got the old. They can get rid of

6419
04:12:58,720 --> 04:13:04,159
them. Morgan going to be able to blast

6420
04:13:00,800 --> 04:13:05,279
his way out. Mega cones abound for the

6421
04:13:04,159 --> 04:13:06,880
disengage.

6422
04:13:05,279 --> 04:13:09,359
So, Apollo really wants to back. Will

6423
04:13:06,880 --> 04:13:11,040
got spotted here. TRX, they can slow

6424
04:13:09,359 --> 04:13:13,760
play this. They already got a lot of

6425
04:13:11,040 --> 04:13:15,199
health and out Apollo. Wow, Teddy really

6426
04:13:13,760 --> 04:13:16,080
taking matters into his own hands, but I

6427
04:13:15,199 --> 04:13:20,080
don't know about that one.

6428
04:13:16,080 --> 04:13:21,520
No, that I do. Wasn't great. Um,

6429
04:13:20,080 --> 04:13:23,439
I think it's fine if you're not looking

6430
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:24,960
to fight, but Drake is up in 30 seconds.

6431
04:13:23,439 --> 04:13:26,720
That old from Teddy I think is a big

6432
04:13:24,960 --> 04:13:27,920
mistake. I actually think that might

6433
04:13:26,720 --> 04:13:30,800
have been bettering in the fight that's

6434
04:13:27,920 --> 04:13:32,159
about to come up. Also, hi has hit free

6435
04:13:30,800 --> 04:13:34,319
items, so I think he really wants to

6436
04:13:32,159 --> 04:13:39,199
fight. Closer also has a stopwatch or

6437
04:13:34,319 --> 04:13:42,720
rather arm guard, but can freeze time.

6438
04:13:39,199 --> 04:13:45,920
They're starting it up again as Oh, DRX.

6439
04:13:42,720 --> 04:13:47,439
This one might work,

6440
04:13:45,920 --> 04:13:49,040
bro. Are we are we even going to like

6441
04:13:47,439 --> 04:13:49,840
walk over there? We don't have any way

6442
04:13:49,040 --> 04:13:51,199
to check this.

6443
04:13:49,840 --> 04:13:52,800
No, it's it's it's definitely gone.

6444
04:13:51,199 --> 04:13:55,439
It's just gone. Yeah.

6445
04:13:52,800 --> 04:13:56,880
Down to 5,000. The dragon has spawned.

6446
04:13:55,439 --> 04:13:58,159
Polo, I think, has an idea of what's

6447
04:13:56,880 --> 04:13:59,600
going on here, but he just can't face

6448
04:13:58,159 --> 04:14:01,439
check. And so the Baron's just going to

6449
04:13:59,600 --> 04:14:04,640
get secured here by DRX under the nose

6450
04:14:01,439 --> 04:14:05,760
of the bros. And yeah, they might be

6451
04:14:04,640 --> 04:14:08,720
able to get a dragon, but it's a

6452
04:14:05,760 --> 04:14:11,439
consolation chem. And that doesn't ever

6453
04:14:08,720 --> 04:14:14,000
feel good. And so DRX have really just

6454
04:14:11,439 --> 04:14:15,199
taken this game back. If it was soul, I

6455
04:14:14,000 --> 04:14:17,920
think it would have been fine. But it's

6456
04:14:15,199 --> 04:14:21,439
not even soul. It's soul point. Atlas.

6457
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:24,319
Yeah. You know what, bro? I don't care.

6458
04:14:21,439 --> 04:14:26,000
It's fine. Just give Nash did. This is

6459
04:14:24,319 --> 04:14:28,960
so weird, though, isn't it? Because like

6460
04:14:26,000 --> 04:14:29,359
they did. That did happen. Watch that

6461
04:14:28,960 --> 04:14:32,479
happen.

6462
04:14:29,359 --> 04:14:35,600
And also, this team is is like mostly

6463
04:14:32,479 --> 04:14:37,840
old sandbox, right? It's not even really

6464
04:14:35,600 --> 04:14:40,720
bro anymore, but it's still the same

6465
04:14:37,840 --> 04:14:43,359
Bro. It's still We can do things in the

6466
04:14:40,720 --> 04:14:45,199
early game to create a lead. And then we

6467
04:14:43,359 --> 04:14:45,680
stop doing stuff,

6468
04:14:45,199 --> 04:14:47,920
you know,

6469
04:14:45,680 --> 04:14:48,560
and then you the enemy just takes all

6470
04:14:47,920 --> 04:14:52,800
the stuff.

6471
04:14:48,560 --> 04:14:54,399
Atlas, the funniest part. It is It's as

6472
04:14:52,800 --> 04:14:56,720
you're saying, it's the same with every

6473
04:14:54,399 --> 04:14:58,319
or KT. It doesn't matter how many points

6474
04:14:56,720 --> 04:14:59,760
you change. It's just KT.

6475
04:14:58,319 --> 04:15:02,000
Yep.

6476
04:14:59,760 --> 04:15:05,199
Um I can't believe I'm saying this, but

6477
04:15:02,000 --> 04:15:07,279
DK, it's just it's just TK.

6478
04:15:05,199 --> 04:15:09,199
Although they did bring barrel back.

6479
04:15:07,279 --> 04:15:11,680
There's examples of this in every

6480
04:15:09,199 --> 04:15:15,040
region. You know, there's Fnatic uh in

6481
04:15:11,680 --> 04:15:16,640
the LC. There is TS in the LPL.

6482
04:15:15,040 --> 04:15:18,640
It's true.

6483
04:15:16,640 --> 04:15:20,880
Sometimes it's just the vibes.

6484
04:15:18,640 --> 04:15:23,680
There used to be a lot in the uh in the

6485
04:15:20,880 --> 04:15:24,560
LTA/LCS, but I mean TSM hasn't been

6486
04:15:23,680 --> 04:15:27,359
around for a while.

6487
04:15:24,560 --> 04:15:29,439
I know. It's a shame.

6488
04:15:27,359 --> 04:15:33,800
I do think the team changed quite a lot

6489
04:15:29,439 --> 04:15:33,800
when it went from Rainman to Dyrus.

6490
04:15:34,720 --> 04:15:40,720
I would say

6491
04:15:37,920 --> 04:15:42,399
cuz Dyus Who is your favorite like OGT?

6492
04:15:40,720 --> 04:15:44,000
For me, it's Oddwan. Yeah, I love the J.

6493
04:15:42,399 --> 04:15:45,760
Oh, Owan's fantastic. Yeah, I think it's

6494
04:15:44,000 --> 04:15:47,600
I think it's like he's almost the

6495
04:15:45,760 --> 04:15:50,000
objective right choice. I always like

6496
04:15:47,600 --> 04:15:51,279
Chaox as well.

6497
04:15:50,000 --> 04:15:52,960
That's right. Yeah. Who does manage to

6498
04:15:51,279 --> 04:15:55,279
take down this turret? We are extending

6499
04:15:52,960 --> 04:15:58,000
this Rebel Baron power play really,

6500
04:15:55,279 --> 04:15:59,600
really far.

6501
04:15:58,000 --> 04:16:01,199
We really are hitting a variety of

6502
04:15:59,600 --> 04:16:03,279
topics as well. I think this bot lane

6503
04:16:01,199 --> 04:16:04,479
turret might have to give it up, bro.

6504
04:16:03,279 --> 04:16:07,920
We'll see if they really want to play

6505
04:16:04,479 --> 04:16:11,040
for a heavy contest with this uh super

6506
04:16:07,920 --> 04:16:12,080
or empowered rather double cannon. I

6507
04:16:11,040 --> 04:16:13,840
don't know if they can really do that

6508
04:16:12,080 --> 04:16:15,199
much. They do have five members in the

6509
04:16:13,840 --> 04:16:16,560
area. The ambassador's rotating around

6510
04:16:15,199 --> 04:16:17,840
as well, but there goes down. They're

6511
04:16:16,560 --> 04:16:19,840
going to look for Andel who goes down

6512
04:16:17,840 --> 04:16:22,319
very low. It's a late steadfast

6513
04:16:19,840 --> 04:16:24,319
presence. But now between Wills, a

6514
04:16:22,319 --> 04:16:26,399
massive knock up though as Morgan finds

6515
04:16:24,319 --> 04:16:28,560
the angle, but the cyclone is just too

6516
04:16:26,399 --> 04:16:31,199
good. And yes, Morgan might be

6517
04:16:28,560 --> 04:16:33,920
surviving, but unfortunately he's lost

6518
04:16:31,199 --> 04:16:35,520
his Annie and his Corki is a little too

6519
04:16:33,920 --> 04:16:39,600
low, so he's just going to get cut down

6520
04:16:35,520 --> 04:16:43,120
where he stands. Oh no, bros. That was a

6521
04:16:39,600 --> 04:16:46,720
backbreaking fight. And TRX utilize

6522
04:16:43,120 --> 04:16:49,120
their Baron sneak. It turns into a 6,000

6523
04:16:46,720 --> 04:16:51,120
Rebel Baron power play. And the game

6524
04:16:49,120 --> 04:16:53,199
might just be over right here. Might

6525
04:16:51,120 --> 04:16:55,760
just look for the end. It's been a

6526
04:16:53,199 --> 04:16:58,000
Sponge and Rich

6527
04:16:55,760 --> 04:16:59,840
duology in these fights. The two of them

6528
04:16:58,000 --> 04:17:01,199
just finding the back line again and

6529
04:16:59,840 --> 04:17:03,199
again. And even though Teddy gets his

6530
04:17:01,199 --> 04:17:06,399
all interrupted, I don't think it really

6531
04:17:03,199 --> 04:17:08,479
matters as Rich dancing around deathless

6532
04:17:06,399 --> 04:17:10,000
on this Ambessa. Yeah, having a great

6533
04:17:08,479 --> 04:17:11,920
time. And we know like Rich actually had

6534
04:17:10,000 --> 04:17:13,279
some pretty good performances as Pul

6535
04:17:11,920 --> 04:17:15,840
going to hit a couple in the backline

6536
04:17:13,279 --> 04:17:17,680
there as Yahoo does die. And in fact, a

6537
04:17:15,840 --> 04:17:18,960
couple of people die to Hype who does a

6538
04:17:17,680 --> 04:17:20,399
fair bit of damage, but it does not

6539
04:17:18,960 --> 04:17:22,239
matter. This nexus is still going to go

6540
04:17:20,399 --> 04:17:24,880
down if Teddy has anything to say about

6541
04:17:22,239 --> 04:17:27,120
it. And he does. He says, "Bring it,

6542
04:17:24,880 --> 04:17:28,960
Bros. We'll take you in game one." And

6543
04:17:27,120 --> 04:17:31,120
we'll see whether the Bros can do it

6544
04:17:28,960 --> 04:17:34,560
again. Last time around, they did manage

6545
04:17:31,120 --> 04:17:36,479
to bounce back, but uh this this was a

6546
04:17:34,560 --> 04:17:42,120
rough one because they had it and then

6547
04:17:36,479 --> 04:17:42,120
they just kind of let it slip.

6548
04:17:42,399 --> 04:17:47,120
It is the classic example of I and I

6549
04:17:45,520 --> 04:17:49,439
don't I don't think the game was won

6550
04:17:47,120 --> 04:17:51,279
early on but they were in a commanding

6551
04:17:49,439 --> 04:17:52,560
lead and and then they threw it out of

6552
04:17:51,279 --> 04:17:52,960
and then they never really got control

6553
04:17:52,560 --> 04:17:53,920
back.

6554
04:17:52,960 --> 04:17:57,199
Yeah,

6555
04:17:53,920 --> 04:18:00,239
as a Sponge fan I am joyous. I am happy.

6556
04:17:57,199 --> 04:18:02,399
Thinky had a great game on the Wukong.

6557
04:18:00,239 --> 04:18:04,800
Teddy actually a clean MF performance as

6558
04:18:02,399 --> 04:18:06,319
well. Not the easiest game to play MF.

6559
04:18:04,800 --> 04:18:08,640
They also kept their heads in it, right?

6560
04:18:06,319 --> 04:18:10,159
Like this was a team that were slowly

6561
04:18:08,640 --> 04:18:11,359
but surely losing their grip on the game

6562
04:18:10,159 --> 04:18:12,560
and they said, "No, we got to do

6563
04:18:11,359 --> 04:18:14,800
something. We got to make our way back

6564
04:18:12,560 --> 04:18:17,760
in." Intelligent play around vision

6565
04:18:14,800 --> 04:18:19,600
control and just caught bro napping.

6566
04:18:17,760 --> 04:18:21,680
Caught them thinking that perhaps it was

6567
04:18:19,600 --> 04:18:24,399
time for a reset. It was not. It was

6568
04:18:21,680 --> 04:18:26,000
time to do Baron yet again

6569
04:18:24,399 --> 04:18:27,199
and they committed to the play. Made it

6570
04:18:26,000 --> 04:18:29,199
work. You can have a look at it in the

6571
04:18:27,199 --> 04:18:32,080
gold graph there. And as soon as they

6572
04:18:29,199 --> 04:18:35,760
had that lead, it was all over. There's

6573
04:18:32,080 --> 04:18:37,840
that man on your screen, the sponge.

6574
04:18:35,760 --> 04:18:39,680
And I think that Wukong is really,

6575
04:18:37,840 --> 04:18:41,520
really strong. That he played a

6576
04:18:39,680 --> 04:18:42,800
fantastic Wukong game.

6577
04:18:41,520 --> 04:18:44,560
And to be able to take it away from the

6578
04:18:42,800 --> 04:18:46,000
Bros after that level of control was

6579
04:18:44,560 --> 04:18:47,680
very impressive. Time for us to go to a

6580
04:18:46,000 --> 04:18:49,359
short break. When we get back, the space

6581
04:18:47,680 --> 04:18:53,159
going to break that one down. We'll have

6582
04:18:49,359 --> 04:18:53,159
game number two. See you soon.

6613
04:25:29,279 --> 04:25:34,880
Hello and welcome back to the LCK space.

6614
04:25:32,800 --> 04:25:37,040
I am Valdez, still joined by Wolf and

6615
04:25:34,880 --> 04:25:39,920
Wad. And that was DRX taking down Dh

6616
04:25:37,040 --> 04:25:41,600
game number one up against Bro. It was a

6617
04:25:39,920 --> 04:25:43,199
pretty close back and forth game. It

6618
04:25:41,600 --> 04:25:45,199
felt like Bro was in the lead for quite

6619
04:25:43,199 --> 04:25:46,720
a while, but then a couple of major

6620
04:25:45,199 --> 04:25:48,479
mistakes in the mid to late game kind of

6621
04:25:46,720 --> 04:25:49,920
led to their demise. Guys, what went

6622
04:25:48,479 --> 04:25:52,319
wrong for Bro there?

6623
04:25:49,920 --> 04:25:53,439
Bro's early game has been pretty clean

6624
04:25:52,319 --> 04:25:55,359
most of this year, right? I mean,

6625
04:25:53,439 --> 04:25:58,000
they're Kespa Cup champions. They did

6626
04:25:55,359 --> 04:26:00,000
they did take that title, but since the

6627
04:25:58,000 --> 04:26:01,920
very beginning of January, this team has

6628
04:26:00,000 --> 04:26:04,479
been able to generate pretty significant

6629
04:26:01,920 --> 04:26:06,880
leads against even top teams. It's what

6630
04:26:04,479 --> 04:26:08,479
happens in the Midame trying to leverage

6631
04:26:06,880 --> 04:26:10,239
that lead where sometimes they trip,

6632
04:26:08,479 --> 04:26:11,359
they stumble, they fall. That's what

6633
04:26:10,239 --> 04:26:13,040
happened here where they had a lot of

6634
04:26:11,359 --> 04:26:16,720
control. They tried to use Oticon as a

6635
04:26:13,040 --> 04:26:18,239
stepping stone and uh you know they kind

6636
04:26:16,720 --> 04:26:19,439
of you know when you step from stone to

6637
04:26:18,239 --> 04:26:20,000
stone they they kind of fell in the

6638
04:26:19,439 --> 04:26:21,840
river.

6639
04:26:20,000 --> 04:26:24,560
Yeah. I mean I think a lot of top tier

6640
04:26:21,840 --> 04:26:27,520
team finally figured out that other is

6641
04:26:24,560 --> 04:26:29,840
not that valuable to uh give your life

6642
04:26:27,520 --> 04:26:31,920
to the enemy team. Uh you just use the

6643
04:26:29,840 --> 04:26:34,880
artakan as a fight method. You know you

6644
04:26:31,920 --> 04:26:37,840
just bait them and bait their TP or even

6645
04:26:34,880 --> 04:26:39,840
though you lose the not over yet. I mean

6646
04:26:37,840 --> 04:26:42,560
it's just whatever. It's not just like a

6647
04:26:39,840 --> 04:26:45,760
Nasher or fourth Drake soul. So I feel

6648
04:26:42,560 --> 04:26:49,760
like uh I I just think that bro just

6649
04:26:45,760 --> 04:26:51,840
didn't uh prioritize uh uh value yet

6650
04:26:49,760 --> 04:26:54,239
about the Atakan. I think that was the

6651
04:26:51,840 --> 04:26:55,600
main part why they lost the on the

6652
04:26:54,239 --> 04:26:57,439
Atakan fight here.

6653
04:26:55,600 --> 04:26:59,359
Yeah, I I think that's definitely true.

6654
04:26:57,439 --> 04:27:01,359
Um, I would say that also a lot of our

6655
04:26:59,359 --> 04:27:04,239
top teams are recognizing the power of

6656
04:27:01,359 --> 04:27:06,399
Aurora and it felt like uh Krakco and

6657
04:27:04,239 --> 04:27:07,840
the Bros didn't really understand the

6658
04:27:06,399 --> 04:27:09,520
power of it and we can actually see

6659
04:27:07,840 --> 04:27:11,199
exactly what I mean here in highlight

6660
04:27:09,520 --> 04:27:13,600
number one. 24 minutes in, they're

6661
04:27:11,199 --> 04:27:15,680
trying to bait on the Oticon and it goes

6662
04:27:13,600 --> 04:27:17,680
horrifically wrong as they run straight

6663
04:27:15,680 --> 04:27:19,279
at the Aurora. Up until this point, I

6664
04:27:17,680 --> 04:27:20,720
was talking to Valdez the whole time. I

6665
04:27:19,279 --> 04:27:21,840
was like, "This is a great call. They're

6666
04:27:20,720 --> 04:27:23,439
using the pressure. They're trying to

6667
04:27:21,840 --> 04:27:25,199
control this tri bush trying but then

6668
04:27:23,439 --> 04:27:27,680
everything goes wrong when Kro decides

6669
04:27:25,199 --> 04:27:30,080
to like try to hold Oticon then look for

6670
04:27:27,680 --> 04:27:31,920
an engage when he's at zero health and

6671
04:27:30,080 --> 04:27:33,439
then this opens everything up because

6672
04:27:31,920 --> 04:27:35,199
the rest of the team has to kite back.

6673
04:27:33,439 --> 04:27:37,680
So Teddy is getting value with this MF

6674
04:27:35,199 --> 04:27:39,520
as he pushes forward. If Bro had looked

6675
04:27:37,680 --> 04:27:41,120
for a faster turn and played through the

6676
04:27:39,520 --> 04:27:42,800
choke point which half of the team was

6677
04:27:41,120 --> 04:27:44,560
doing instead of trying to stick onto

6678
04:27:42,800 --> 04:27:46,479
the Oticon like Crocco was doing before

6679
04:27:44,560 --> 04:27:48,000
he looked for the lackluster turn. I

6680
04:27:46,479 --> 04:27:49,520
still think this call is correct. It's

6681
04:27:48,000 --> 04:27:51,439
not because you're trying to get the

6682
04:27:49,520 --> 04:27:52,720
Oticon. It's because you're trying to

6683
04:27:51,439 --> 04:27:54,960
use the lead and the control you have

6684
04:27:52,720 --> 04:27:57,520
over the map to force that fight, but

6685
04:27:54,960 --> 04:27:59,520
the turn was just so poor. It was so

6686
04:27:57,520 --> 04:28:00,640
poorly executed that they just got wiped

6687
04:27:59,520 --> 04:28:02,800
and lost the game over it.

6688
04:28:00,640 --> 04:28:04,800
Yeah, I think uh whenever you play

6689
04:28:02,800 --> 04:28:07,600
around this objective, you have to check

6690
04:28:04,800 --> 04:28:10,720
the objective HP. I think the level of

6691
04:28:07,600 --> 04:28:12,640
the HP is the 6k. The that's the lowest.

6692
04:28:10,720 --> 04:28:14,640
So after that, I think you have to stop

6693
04:28:12,640 --> 04:28:17,439
hitting the objective and turn. But if

6694
04:28:14,640 --> 04:28:19,040
you're hitting more than that, then that

6695
04:28:17,439 --> 04:28:21,199
becomes really interesting cuz it's

6696
04:28:19,040 --> 04:28:23,279
lower than 6k, then enemy team can

6697
04:28:21,199 --> 04:28:25,199
actually just have the objective. So at

6698
04:28:23,279 --> 04:28:27,439
that point, you start to confuse

6699
04:28:25,199 --> 04:28:29,680
yourself. And I think that's the the

6700
04:28:27,439 --> 04:28:30,239
reason why bro kind of confused in that

6701
04:28:29,680 --> 04:28:32,000
point.

6702
04:28:30,239 --> 04:28:33,520
Yeah, I mean it can be difficult, you

6703
04:28:32,000 --> 04:28:35,279
know, to get all five players on the

6704
04:28:33,520 --> 04:28:36,880
same page and to get the exact right

6705
04:28:35,279 --> 04:28:38,239
turn. It was obvious that that's this

6706
04:28:36,880 --> 04:28:40,159
was kind of the opposite of that, the

6707
04:28:38,239 --> 04:28:42,000
exact not right turn. And uh immediately

6708
04:28:40,159 --> 04:28:44,000
DRX were just waiting with open arms to

6709
04:28:42,000 --> 04:28:45,680
take that one down. And they did so as

6710
04:28:44,000 --> 04:28:47,279
well in highlight number two which was

6711
04:28:45,680 --> 04:28:49,840
the ending fight of the game actually

6712
04:28:47,279 --> 04:28:51,760
where this Aurora all just gets massive

6713
04:28:49,840 --> 04:28:53,760
value in this fight. It's an attempted

6714
04:28:51,760 --> 04:28:56,479
flank here from Bro. They look for the

6715
04:28:53,760 --> 04:28:59,600
pick unfortunately onto the very very

6716
04:28:56,479 --> 04:29:01,760
tanky Poppy and then Wukong Aurora.

6717
04:28:59,600 --> 04:29:03,840
You're in the circles. You are in the

6718
04:29:01,760 --> 04:29:06,000
death chamber. Even this MF ultimate on

6719
04:29:03,840 --> 04:29:07,920
the side is tangentially relevant. The

6720
04:29:06,000 --> 04:29:10,960
combo here is so strong for D. I mean

6721
04:29:07,920 --> 04:29:13,199
just look at your scion position is not

6722
04:29:10,960 --> 04:29:16,159
structured team fight again your scion

6723
04:29:13,199 --> 04:29:18,319
is on the bot side your tank cannot just

6724
04:29:16,159 --> 04:29:20,000
be on your front that means the

6725
04:29:18,319 --> 04:29:22,239
structure of the team fight is already

6726
04:29:20,000 --> 04:29:24,080
destroyed if like if you get the one

6727
04:29:22,239 --> 04:29:26,399
kill and when you're behind just be

6728
04:29:24,080 --> 04:29:29,199
happy with it small victory just set for

6729
04:29:26,399 --> 04:29:31,600
next play but I think the overchase is

6730
04:29:29,199 --> 04:29:33,760
always bad whenever you are behind and I

6731
04:29:31,600 --> 04:29:34,239
think it was just a horrible fight at

6732
04:29:33,760 --> 04:29:36,080
the end

6733
04:29:34,239 --> 04:29:38,560
I liked bros draft I like the position

6734
04:29:36,080 --> 04:29:40,399
they had in this him. If they executed

6735
04:29:38,560 --> 04:29:42,000
better on Oticon or look for trying to

6736
04:29:40,399 --> 04:29:43,920
threaten Oticon and rather instead of

6737
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:45,359
trying to hold it or played that topside

6738
04:29:43,920 --> 04:29:46,720
fight a little bit differently, we're

6739
04:29:45,359 --> 04:29:48,720
probably looking at a bro one zero,

6740
04:29:46,720 --> 04:29:50,640
right? So, you've got to keep yourself

6741
04:29:48,720 --> 04:29:52,319
mentally on the right page, on the right

6742
04:29:50,640 --> 04:29:54,080
mindset moving into game two, knowing

6743
04:29:52,319 --> 04:29:55,439
that game one was a winnable game.

6744
04:29:54,080 --> 04:29:57,439
You've still got strong drafts in the

6745
04:29:55,439 --> 04:29:59,279
bag. I mean, or just relax a little bit

6746
04:29:57,439 --> 04:30:02,000
more. Even though Atakan is up in the

6747
04:29:59,279 --> 04:30:04,479
map, there is still a Drake and Nasher

6748
04:30:02,000 --> 04:30:06,159
to go on. And I feel like uh you're not

6749
04:30:04,479 --> 04:30:08,000
the one who's like really feeling

6750
04:30:06,159 --> 04:30:10,239
rushed. You know, if enemy team is

6751
04:30:08,000 --> 04:30:12,159
behind, they can start the ATA is more

6752
04:30:10,239 --> 04:30:13,680
risky and you can actually go on the

6753
04:30:12,159 --> 04:30:15,520
objective and take the better fight. But

6754
04:30:13,680 --> 04:30:16,880
I feel like whenever bro is ahead,

6755
04:30:15,520 --> 04:30:18,239
they're just like, "Oh my god, we are

6756
04:30:16,880 --> 04:30:20,399
ahead. We have to finish the game

6757
04:30:18,239 --> 04:30:23,120
earlier." And now like we're panicking

6758
04:30:20,399 --> 04:30:25,439
cuz we can't finish the game, but you

6759
04:30:23,120 --> 04:30:27,040
have to relax and just chill chill a

6760
04:30:25,439 --> 04:30:28,960
little bit more in game. And I think

6761
04:30:27,040 --> 04:30:31,199
whenever they have the early game lead,

6762
04:30:28,960 --> 04:30:33,760
it feels good. But in the mid late game,

6763
04:30:31,199 --> 04:30:35,520
they just need to fix the calls and uh

6764
04:30:33,760 --> 04:30:37,120
the plans in in game. Yeah, I mean

6765
04:30:35,520 --> 04:30:39,439
that's how I feel. You know, it's just a

6766
04:30:37,120 --> 04:30:40,399
little thing. But yeah, just happy with

6767
04:30:39,439 --> 04:30:42,080
the small victory.

6768
04:30:40,399 --> 04:30:44,319
Yeah, also something to mention, you

6769
04:30:42,080 --> 04:30:46,080
know, Edgar was uh released from the

6770
04:30:44,319 --> 04:30:47,600
team and also they have brought in Duke.

6771
04:30:46,080 --> 04:30:49,439
So pretty interesting to see what he's

6772
04:30:47,600 --> 04:30:51,520
going to be able to do with uh Bro here

6773
04:30:49,439 --> 04:30:52,880
in rounds three to five of the LCK. But

6774
04:30:51,520 --> 04:30:54,000
we're done here on the space, guys.

6775
04:30:52,880 --> 04:30:57,279
Let's throw it back to Atlas and

6776
04:30:54,000 --> 04:31:00,000
Chronicler for the cast.

6777
04:30:57,279 --> 04:31:01,760
Thank you very much, Valdoast, for that

6778
04:31:00,000 --> 04:31:04,080
one. Absolutely fantastic breakdown

6779
04:31:01,760 --> 04:31:07,279
there of game number one. And do you

6780
04:31:04,080 --> 04:31:09,760
know what? Juke has already showed us

6781
04:31:07,279 --> 04:31:12,399
that he can do it. That he can turn the

6782
04:31:09,760 --> 04:31:15,040
ship around because DK beat them in game

6783
04:31:12,399 --> 04:31:18,000
one. And by Jove. After that, it did not

6784
04:31:15,040 --> 04:31:19,600
look close.

6785
04:31:18,000 --> 04:31:20,720
I had to because of the by Jove.

6786
04:31:19,600 --> 04:31:22,080
Yeah. I don't know why I went with the

6787
04:31:20,720 --> 04:31:25,600
That was that was warranted, right?

6788
04:31:22,080 --> 04:31:27,120
Yeah. No, fair enough.

6789
04:31:25,600 --> 04:31:29,199
I can't wait to see what the next game

6790
04:31:27,120 --> 04:31:33,040
is going to bring us. I think that we

6791
04:31:29,199 --> 04:31:34,080
are yet again graced with peak LCK.

6792
04:31:33,040 --> 04:31:37,040
Oh yeah.

6793
04:31:34,080 --> 04:31:38,880
And what type of peak? That's the beauty

6794
04:31:37,040 --> 04:31:39,359
of art. It can be anything you want it

6795
04:31:38,880 --> 04:31:40,640
to be.

6796
04:31:39,359 --> 04:31:41,840
Exactly. You got to get to the top of

6797
04:31:40,640 --> 04:31:44,319
the mountain before you know what that

6798
04:31:41,840 --> 04:31:45,359
peak is going to look like.

6799
04:31:44,319 --> 04:31:46,319
Have you Have you heard of the game

6800
04:31:45,359 --> 04:31:46,720
Peak, by the way?

6801
04:31:46,319 --> 04:31:48,560
Peak.

6802
04:31:46,720 --> 04:31:50,319
We should play it. It's like you climb a

6803
04:31:48,560 --> 04:31:51,520
mountain and and it's very funny.

6804
04:31:50,319 --> 04:31:53,199
It's like getting over it.

6805
04:31:51,520 --> 04:31:55,120
No, you like you climb the mountain in

6806
04:31:53,199 --> 04:31:55,520
it. It's like co-op. You climb a

6807
04:31:55,120 --> 04:31:56,479
mountain.

6808
04:31:55,520 --> 04:31:57,680
Oh, that actually sounds pretty cool.

6809
04:31:56,479 --> 04:31:58,479
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we should. We should.

6810
04:31:57,680 --> 04:32:00,080
That'll be good.

6811
04:31:58,479 --> 04:32:02,239
All right. Well, Nico is going to get

6812
04:32:00,080 --> 04:32:04,159
banned away yet again. Nico, Gwen, and

6813
04:32:02,239 --> 04:32:06,000
Varys were the bands on the blue side

6814
04:32:04,159 --> 04:32:10,159
last time around for the Bros. Remember,

6815
04:32:06,000 --> 04:32:12,399
the Bros had blue side in game one and

6816
04:32:10,159 --> 04:32:14,239
did not quite find the victory. So, we

6817
04:32:12,399 --> 04:32:16,080
might have just mirrored bands here.

6818
04:32:14,239 --> 04:32:18,000
Although the Varys is out of order.

6819
04:32:16,080 --> 04:32:20,960
might give away that we are looking at a

6820
04:32:18,000 --> 04:32:23,359
different choice over the Gwen or maybe

6821
04:32:20,960 --> 04:32:28,080
a Gwen first pick for the Lord.

6822
04:32:23,359 --> 04:32:29,920
Gwen first pick could be the case. I

6823
04:32:28,080 --> 04:32:31,520
think not having to deal with this Poppy

6824
04:32:29,920 --> 04:32:33,359
that seemed to be baiting them into all

6825
04:32:31,520 --> 04:32:34,800
sorts of frustrating fights.

6826
04:32:33,359 --> 04:32:36,640
Well, there was there was a lot, right?

6827
04:32:34,800 --> 04:32:37,680
I think that Morgan unfortunately also

6828
04:32:36,640 --> 04:32:39,199
didn't really have the impact on the

6829
04:32:37,680 --> 04:32:40,479
sign like especially looking back to

6830
04:32:39,199 --> 04:32:42,880
some of the replays. I think his fights

6831
04:32:40,479 --> 04:32:43,920
were lackluster. Obviously, the space

6832
04:32:42,880 --> 04:32:46,800
already went over Crocco's

6833
04:32:43,920 --> 04:32:49,439
decision-making. Also, I think Paulo

6834
04:32:46,800 --> 04:32:52,000
again, warm-up game from him on the

6835
04:32:49,439 --> 04:32:53,520
Alistister outside of the early game.

6836
04:32:52,000 --> 04:32:55,199
Uh, no, not for closer. I think closer

6837
04:32:53,520 --> 04:32:56,800
and hype really did all they could.

6838
04:32:55,199 --> 04:32:59,199
Yeah, the doing fine.

6839
04:32:56,800 --> 04:33:01,520
I

6840
04:32:59,199 --> 04:33:02,800
the more I see of them, it's again, we

6841
04:33:01,520 --> 04:33:04,160
need to remind everyone that the

6842
04:33:02,800 --> 04:33:06,240
difference between these two teams in

6843
04:33:04,160 --> 04:33:08,480
actual score is very minimal. And I

6844
04:33:06,240 --> 04:33:10,320
think it's cuz DRX do sometimes just

6845
04:33:08,480 --> 04:33:11,359
kind of make the right call again and

6846
04:33:10,320 --> 04:33:13,600
again. Yeah,

6847
04:33:11,359 --> 04:33:16,240
like in that game they were just falling

6848
04:33:13,600 --> 04:33:18,561
too far behind biting their time as Gwen

6849
04:33:16,240 --> 04:33:20,240
B. Is it like B1 or I don't think it

6850
04:33:18,561 --> 04:33:21,600
should be like

6851
04:33:20,240 --> 04:33:23,279
it's a bit of a pick your poison though,

6852
04:33:21,600 --> 04:33:25,039
isn't it? Because both the Tia and the

6853
04:33:23,279 --> 04:33:26,240
Azir are left off. So I expect neither

6854
04:33:25,039 --> 04:33:29,199
of those to be banned

6855
04:33:26,240 --> 04:33:30,400
and then they will pick Azir for closer

6856
04:33:29,199 --> 04:33:30,799
cuz he can play that.

6857
04:33:30,400 --> 04:33:31,760
Yeah,

6858
04:33:30,799 --> 04:33:34,000
that's a thing.

6859
04:33:31,760 --> 04:33:36,000
Although it might be good if you pick

6860
04:33:34,000 --> 04:33:37,359
Leah to have a better lane match up.

6861
04:33:36,000 --> 04:33:40,799
That might not be what they

6862
04:33:37,359 --> 04:33:43,199
So I I actually post nerves.

6863
04:33:40,799 --> 04:33:45,119
Oh god, they're just going to post buffs

6864
04:33:43,199 --> 04:33:46,959
to Azair. I'm like I actually think that

6865
04:33:45,119 --> 04:33:49,199
the

6866
04:33:46,959 --> 04:33:51,359
the matchup like it used to be really

6867
04:33:49,199 --> 04:33:53,840
favored. I don't think it still is. I

6868
04:33:51,359 --> 04:33:56,240
think the buffs to air which again kind

6869
04:33:53,840 --> 04:33:56,959
of mystified all of us at the OCK.

6870
04:33:56,240 --> 04:33:58,400
Yeah, given

6871
04:33:56,959 --> 04:34:00,320
I've already in by the way. I don't know

6872
04:33:58,400 --> 04:34:01,920
why they're taking so long.

6873
04:34:00,320 --> 04:34:04,000
What is this closer? If there is a guy

6874
04:34:01,920 --> 04:34:06,080
that's like no no I got to counter pick.

6875
04:34:04,000 --> 04:34:08,799
Look at his face. That's the man that's

6876
04:34:06,080 --> 04:34:10,480
like, "It's fine. I'll just pick Akali."

6877
04:34:08,799 --> 04:34:11,039
And then they're like, "Okay, closer. We

6878
04:34:10,480 --> 04:34:13,279
trust you."

6879
04:34:11,039 --> 04:34:14,799
I mean, honestly, he is closer. That is

6880
04:34:13,279 --> 04:34:15,760
something that he's very likely to do.

6881
04:34:14,799 --> 04:34:16,639
Tell me he wouldn't do that.

6882
04:34:15,760 --> 04:34:17,680
Oh, no. He would do that.

6883
04:34:16,639 --> 04:34:19,760
He would do that.

6884
04:34:17,680 --> 04:34:21,279
That might actually be the play. Oh, no.

6885
04:34:19,760 --> 04:34:24,000
No, no, no. You're You know what it is?

6886
04:34:21,279 --> 04:34:26,240
He's going to swway it. He's just going

6887
04:34:24,000 --> 04:34:28,160
to swain his way in. You remember that?

6888
04:34:26,240 --> 04:34:29,840
Is like that was his Azia counter pick

6889
04:34:28,160 --> 04:34:31,600
like a year ago, 2 years ago, something

6890
04:34:29,840 --> 04:34:34,799
like that. Yeah, I think there was a

6891
04:34:31,600 --> 04:34:36,320
time and place for Swain. Um, I don't

6892
04:34:34,799 --> 04:34:36,959
know when, but this is a no-brainer,

6893
04:34:36,320 --> 04:34:38,400
obviously.

6894
04:34:36,959 --> 04:34:41,680
Yeah, this was always going to happen.

6895
04:34:38,400 --> 04:34:44,879
Um, if if it's just if he just picks

6896
04:34:41,680 --> 04:34:48,000
Rise, I'm going to be so upset

6897
04:34:44,879 --> 04:34:49,920
because it's just not better.

6898
04:34:48,000 --> 04:34:51,439
I would like Gallo. I think Gallo into

6899
04:34:49,920 --> 04:34:53,359
Rumble is really good.

6900
04:34:51,439 --> 04:34:55,119
Gallo and Or I think are the two picks

6901
04:34:53,359 --> 04:34:58,959
that we've seen consistently work into

6902
04:34:55,119 --> 04:35:01,760
this top side menace.

6903
04:34:58,959 --> 04:35:04,799
What are we picking up here? eyes will

6904
04:35:01,760 --> 04:35:06,080
be a little lackluster.

6905
04:35:04,799 --> 04:35:08,561
Okay, so we're just playing R.

6906
04:35:06,080 --> 04:35:11,119
That is that is that is very actually

6907
04:35:08,561 --> 04:35:12,400
that is the most lift sandbox 2022 thing

6908
04:35:11,119 --> 04:35:12,639
that you could go for.

6909
04:35:12,400 --> 04:35:14,240
Yeah.

6910
04:35:12,639 --> 04:35:16,080
Uh this combo hasn't really worked

6911
04:35:14,240 --> 04:35:16,879
nearly as well. We do have to highlight

6912
04:35:16,080 --> 04:35:18,160
that.

6913
04:35:16,879 --> 04:35:20,160
Nope. I am uh

6914
04:35:18,160 --> 04:35:23,439
you're Yeah, I can hear I can hear the

6915
04:35:20,160 --> 04:35:26,879
bro Leaf dying in Atlas's voice, guys.

6916
04:35:23,439 --> 04:35:28,799
Well, no. I mean, it's not I just didn't

6917
04:35:26,879 --> 04:35:31,520
need them to make it way harder for

6918
04:35:28,799 --> 04:35:35,039
themselves, you know? That's that's all.

6919
04:35:31,520 --> 04:35:36,879
Okay, we're just Atrox and the Rumble.

6920
04:35:35,039 --> 04:35:38,959
Okay, Morgan, I kind of like that. Get

6921
04:35:36,879 --> 04:35:40,160
the lord on a on something that can do a

6922
04:35:38,959 --> 04:35:41,439
damage.

6923
04:35:40,160 --> 04:35:43,840
[Music]

6924
04:35:41,439 --> 04:35:45,279
Sponge like both Trundle and Scarnner go

6925
04:35:43,840 --> 04:35:47,600
so hard here by the way.

6926
04:35:45,279 --> 04:35:50,879
Yeah,

6927
04:35:47,600 --> 04:35:53,359
Sponge one of them. He is

6928
04:35:50,879 --> 04:35:55,840
He is more He's more of a Trundle guy, I

6929
04:35:53,359 --> 04:35:57,119
think. It's like out of tank play for SP

6930
04:35:55,840 --> 04:35:58,240
although he did spend a lot of time on

6931
04:35:57,119 --> 04:36:00,639
Sichuani.

6932
04:35:58,240 --> 04:36:02,000
Oh yeahani.

6933
04:36:00,639 --> 04:36:03,119
The Scarnner has been one of his better

6934
04:36:02,000 --> 04:36:05,119
picks in the past. But it will be the

6935
04:36:03,119 --> 04:36:07,119
Trundle.

6936
04:36:05,119 --> 04:36:08,480
I think it should have been Scarnner,

6937
04:36:07,119 --> 04:36:09,840
but if you're a jungler, you want to

6938
04:36:08,480 --> 04:36:10,639
play Trundle cuz you feel like you

6939
04:36:09,840 --> 04:36:12,719
actually get dead.

6940
04:36:10,639 --> 04:36:14,160
Yeah, Scarnner is here just feels feels

6941
04:36:12,719 --> 04:36:15,439
too good, doesn't it?

6942
04:36:14,160 --> 04:36:19,080
Oh, you're you're just like, "No, no,

6943
04:36:15,439 --> 04:36:19,080
no. That's that's too

6944
04:36:20,000 --> 04:36:23,920
How do you really feel? Tell me tell me

6945
04:36:21,920 --> 04:36:27,039
Atlas about this draft so far. I think

6946
04:36:23,920 --> 04:36:30,240
Azir is extraordinarily strong. He has

6947
04:36:27,039 --> 04:36:32,080
been for uh and he and he has been and

6948
04:36:30,240 --> 04:36:32,719
he's again and he even more so than he

6949
04:36:32,080 --> 04:36:35,600
was before.

6950
04:36:32,719 --> 04:36:38,959
Yep. It's fine. This is going to six

6951
04:36:35,600 --> 04:36:40,320
that we knew this coming into the day.

6952
04:36:38,959 --> 04:36:41,600
I don't think there's a way around it.

6953
04:36:40,320 --> 04:36:42,799
So, Bro is going to find a way to make

6954
04:36:41,600 --> 04:36:45,199
it happen.

6955
04:36:42,799 --> 04:36:46,799
They wouldn't deny us a game game six.

6956
04:36:45,199 --> 04:36:48,320
No, surely we're not. We're not. It's

6957
04:36:46,799 --> 04:36:50,561
not going to be a cringe fight. It's

6958
04:36:48,320 --> 04:36:53,199
never It's It's never And it's not going

6959
04:36:50,561 --> 04:36:54,561
to be Bro that fails to give us it.

6960
04:36:53,199 --> 04:36:58,639
Well, okay. But what if they thought

6961
04:36:54,561 --> 04:37:01,119
that DRX really needed this?

6962
04:36:58,639 --> 04:37:01,680
It's a really good point. And DX do kind

6963
04:37:01,119 --> 04:37:03,439
of need this.

6964
04:37:01,680 --> 04:37:04,320
What's the tech situation like, Atlas?

6965
04:37:03,439 --> 04:37:06,000
That's what I'm wondering.

6966
04:37:04,320 --> 04:37:07,600
Well, honestly, it's not very purple in

6967
04:37:06,000 --> 04:37:09,920
the chat right now. So, it might have

6968
04:37:07,600 --> 04:37:11,920
been that uh during this draft, they

6969
04:37:09,920 --> 04:37:16,480
just didn't quite uh get

6970
04:37:11,920 --> 04:37:19,279
they didn't hit the taxation donations

6971
04:37:16,480 --> 04:37:22,160
to to to reach the good picks. Uh

6972
04:37:19,279 --> 04:37:23,920
Tomkench is an odd ban. Maybe they were

6973
04:37:22,160 --> 04:37:25,439
expecting Teddy to just jinx because

6974
04:37:23,920 --> 04:37:26,959
Teddy has been known to jinx.

6975
04:37:25,439 --> 04:37:29,439
I think it could have been like Santa

6976
04:37:26,959 --> 04:37:31,279
Kench and then you if they if you pick

6977
04:37:29,439 --> 04:37:33,760
Santa Kench and

6978
04:37:31,279 --> 04:37:35,039
you don't have a way to dive, I think

6979
04:37:33,760 --> 04:37:38,160
you just lose the game. So they're going

6980
04:37:35,039 --> 04:37:39,520
to go what? Like chin. Lucian makes

6981
04:37:38,160 --> 04:37:41,039
sense. You're going to go Lucian Braum.

6982
04:37:39,520 --> 04:37:42,719
Lucian Braum is good.

6983
04:37:41,039 --> 04:37:44,000
Wouldn't mind it. Doesn't give them a

6984
04:37:42,719 --> 04:37:45,600
massive amount of engage, but when

6985
04:37:44,000 --> 04:37:46,959
you've got pillar and equalizer, I think

6986
04:37:45,600 --> 04:37:49,039
you're happy just to kind of fish for

6987
04:37:46,959 --> 04:37:49,359
pillar angles and then throw fire on

6988
04:37:49,039 --> 04:37:50,799
top.

6989
04:37:49,359 --> 04:37:53,600
I'm not going to lie. Uh they will

6990
04:37:50,799 --> 04:37:55,520
engage. I I don't know what Bro is going

6991
04:37:53,600 --> 04:37:57,279
to pick here, but there's not a lot

6992
04:37:55,520 --> 04:37:58,320
left. Like you can't really pivot away

6993
04:37:57,279 --> 04:38:01,119
from this composition.

6994
04:37:58,320 --> 04:38:01,840
Draven Pike goes so hard here for the

6995
04:38:01,119 --> 04:38:03,760
Bros.

6996
04:38:01,840 --> 04:38:07,119
I'm not about Polo Pike. I'm not going

6997
04:38:03,760 --> 04:38:10,080
to lie, you could go Jinx for like Jinx

6998
04:38:07,119 --> 04:38:12,000
actually I could see. I think hype has

6999
04:38:10,080 --> 04:38:13,920
actually been a really good Ash also

7000
04:38:12,000 --> 04:38:15,840
would be good follow up with the arrow.

7001
04:38:13,920 --> 04:38:19,520
Ezreal is a lot safer though and also

7002
04:38:15,840 --> 04:38:23,760
does do well into the Trundle and Azer

7003
04:38:19,520 --> 04:38:27,279
portion. I don't think it's great into

7004
04:38:23,760 --> 04:38:28,561
stealing away. So you go as as Braum to

7005
04:38:27,279 --> 04:38:30,959
not have to deal with that and then they

7006
04:38:28,561 --> 04:38:32,879
go what? Re

7007
04:38:30,959 --> 04:38:33,439
was banned. Oh yeah, you're right. I

7008
04:38:32,879 --> 04:38:35,520
them.

7009
04:38:33,439 --> 04:38:37,039
So it has to if they want engage it

7010
04:38:35,520 --> 04:38:38,639
almost.

7011
04:38:37,039 --> 04:38:41,600
I don't know about Leona.

7012
04:38:38,639 --> 04:38:42,639
Nautilus could have been

7013
04:38:41,600 --> 04:38:45,119
worse. Yeah.

7014
04:38:42,639 --> 04:38:46,719
Um Andel is giggling a lot. Maybe it's

7015
04:38:45,119 --> 04:38:49,760
Zach time.

7016
04:38:46,719 --> 04:38:51,520
I just I don't support Trundle.

7017
04:38:49,760 --> 04:38:54,561
I mean Leona like at least you can fish

7018
04:38:51,520 --> 04:38:56,959
with Al, right? It's something

7019
04:38:54,561 --> 04:38:59,680
doesn't feel great.

7020
04:38:56,959 --> 04:39:03,680
Maybe that was the master stroke. The

7021
04:38:59,680 --> 04:39:05,840
Bros were looking for the Braum pick for

7022
04:39:03,680 --> 04:39:07,760
Paulo here in this game. They have

7023
04:39:05,840 --> 04:39:09,520
plenty of other ways to get in there. Of

7024
04:39:07,760 --> 04:39:11,680
course, Crocco just presses R, throws

7025
04:39:09,520 --> 04:39:13,359
his whole body in. He didn't need an R

7026
04:39:11,680 --> 04:39:16,799
button to do that. We watched him do it

7027
04:39:13,359 --> 04:39:18,160
all game long in the previous one. So,

7028
04:39:16,799 --> 04:39:19,760
let's see whether the Bros can turn it

7029
04:39:18,160 --> 04:39:22,320
around. Turn it around is something that

7030
04:39:19,760 --> 04:39:25,359
they've been able to do in the past. And

7031
04:39:22,320 --> 04:39:27,439
by the past, I mean two days ago.

7032
04:39:25,359 --> 04:39:30,480
So bouncing back here should not be a

7033
04:39:27,439 --> 04:39:33,199
big surprise, but it was a a redside

7034
04:39:30,480 --> 04:39:36,080
victory there for DRX. Once again, the

7035
04:39:33,199 --> 04:39:38,958
Bros wear the same colored shorts as

7036
04:39:36,080 --> 04:39:41,280
they head towards the rift. We saw it

7037
04:39:38,958 --> 04:39:42,480
earlier on today though, Chronicler. It

7038
04:39:41,280 --> 04:39:44,320
doesn't really matter what side you're

7039
04:39:42,480 --> 04:39:46,320
on. If the vibes are on your side, you

7040
04:39:44,320 --> 04:39:50,638
can win. T1 showed us that as they took

7041
04:39:46,320 --> 04:39:52,798
away the winning streak for Gen.

7042
04:39:50,638 --> 04:39:57,638
Let's see how this one is going to go.

7043
04:39:52,798 --> 04:39:57,638
DRX fans looking pretty happy today.

7044
04:39:58,240 --> 04:40:00,560
Oh, what are we celebrating? I don't

7045
04:39:59,600 --> 04:40:02,000
know what we're celebrating.

7046
04:40:00,560 --> 04:40:03,200
Yeah, I don't know. I can't read.

7047
04:40:02,000 --> 04:40:05,120
I see a lot of hearts.

7048
04:40:03,200 --> 04:40:07,760
Yeah, I imag Is it Are we like Are we

7049
04:40:05,120 --> 04:40:10,240
getting married? What are we doing? Is

7050
04:40:07,760 --> 04:40:13,680
it the date? Married today?

7051
04:40:10,240 --> 04:40:14,878
Married today? What the heck? What? The

7052
04:40:13,680 --> 04:40:16,958
wedding was this morning and you're

7053
04:40:14,878 --> 04:40:18,878
like, "Oh, just get out of the gown, get

7054
04:40:16,958 --> 04:40:21,600
out of the tux, and let's just uh let's

7055
04:40:18,878 --> 04:40:23,120
just head to L Park."

7056
04:40:21,600 --> 04:40:25,040
Damn. I kind of love that.

7057
04:40:23,120 --> 04:40:26,798
That is swift. If that was like

7058
04:40:25,040 --> 04:40:29,520
Oh, so the legal the legal

7059
04:40:26,798 --> 04:40:32,638
ah legally married today. I was going to

7060
04:40:29,520 --> 04:40:34,718
say like they look surprisingly sober.

7061
04:40:32,638 --> 04:40:36,000
Uh from my experience in marriages a

7062
04:40:34,718 --> 04:40:37,360
little bit different here in Korea. I

7063
04:40:36,000 --> 04:40:39,760
think they they keep it a little bit

7064
04:40:37,360 --> 04:40:41,520
more cordial. Um as we have

7065
04:40:39,760 --> 04:40:43,360
I was at your wedding. I can

7066
04:40:41,520 --> 04:40:44,560
Yeah. Cordial. Cordial.

7067
04:40:43,360 --> 04:40:46,718
Can attest.

7068
04:40:44,560 --> 04:40:50,958
I said cordial like cordial like as in

7069
04:40:46,718 --> 04:40:52,480
you what you drink. Um so yeah. Uh,

7070
04:40:50,958 --> 04:40:53,920
that's impressive. If it's just signing

7071
04:40:52,480 --> 04:40:55,920
the paperwork though, that makes a lot

7072
04:40:53,920 --> 04:40:57,920
more sense cuz that was just you go to

7073
04:40:55,920 --> 04:40:59,200
the to the office

7074
04:40:57,920 --> 04:41:00,320
and then you sign some papers.

7075
04:40:59,200 --> 04:41:00,798
Then you sign some papers. That's what

7076
04:41:00,320 --> 04:41:02,798
you do.

7077
04:41:00,798 --> 04:41:03,360
But it doesn't really feel real.

7078
04:41:02,798 --> 04:41:04,718
It doesn't.

7079
04:41:03,360 --> 04:41:06,638
Cuz we both did that, right?

7080
04:41:04,718 --> 04:41:08,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I also did it like a

7081
04:41:06,638 --> 04:41:10,240
year and a half late as well. Chair and

7082
04:41:08,480 --> 04:41:11,760
I weren't officially married till like a

7083
04:41:10,240 --> 04:41:12,400
year and a half after you did it the

7084
04:41:11,760 --> 04:41:13,920
other way around.

7085
04:41:12,400 --> 04:41:14,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We did it the

7086
04:41:13,920 --> 04:41:18,040
other way.

7087
04:41:14,320 --> 04:41:18,040
Wait, what? That's

7088
04:41:18,240 --> 04:41:21,440
cuz I don't I don't really need the

7089
04:41:19,920 --> 04:41:22,638
government to tell me whether I'm

7090
04:41:21,440 --> 04:41:24,560
married or not, you know?

7091
04:41:22,638 --> 04:41:27,360
Well, yeah, I guess. But that that is

7092
04:41:24,560 --> 04:41:28,798
the that I I mean I guess it depends on

7093
04:41:27,360 --> 04:41:29,760
how you look at it. Arguably the more

7094
04:41:28,798 --> 04:41:31,120
important part.

7095
04:41:29,760 --> 04:41:32,320
I mean, it depends. It depends what your

7096
04:41:31,120 --> 04:41:34,320
situation is, right? Cuz some people

7097
04:41:32,320 --> 04:41:35,600
like me, especially if you're in a

7098
04:41:34,320 --> 04:41:37,200
different country and like maybe you

7099
04:41:35,600 --> 04:41:38,798
need it for visa reasons and stuff like

7100
04:41:37,200 --> 04:41:39,680
that, but uh we didn't really need it

7101
04:41:38,798 --> 04:41:41,760
for any of that.

7102
04:41:39,680 --> 04:41:43,760
Oh, yeah. I would love a chaf as well.

7103
04:41:41,760 --> 04:41:45,440
Well, that's a fun one. That is a really

7104
04:41:43,760 --> 04:41:46,480
That's actually one of the cutest joke

7105
04:41:45,440 --> 04:41:47,520
drawings I've ever seen.

7106
04:41:46,480 --> 04:41:48,480
It's very cute.

7107
04:41:47,520 --> 04:41:50,958
That is adorable.

7108
04:41:48,480 --> 04:41:53,200
And it's all like almost like a bit of a

7109
04:41:50,958 --> 04:41:55,040
Renekton Choath as well, which is a very

7110
04:41:53,200 --> 04:41:56,080
Morgan theme, which I kind of really

7111
04:41:55,040 --> 04:41:58,080
enjoy.

7112
04:41:56,080 --> 04:42:01,840
It is the mashup.

7113
04:41:58,080 --> 04:42:04,718
Um, we just realized that uh there is a

7114
04:42:01,840 --> 04:42:05,200
pause um at this point in time.

7115
04:42:04,718 --> 04:42:06,718
That's fine.

7116
04:42:05,200 --> 04:42:09,360
We are take having a little bit of a

7117
04:42:06,718 --> 04:42:11,840
delay getting into the game. I only just

7118
04:42:09,360 --> 04:42:14,080
noticed now that it's been taking a

7119
04:42:11,840 --> 04:42:14,400
while after we had a very long

7120
04:42:14,080 --> 04:42:15,920
competition.

7121
04:42:14,400 --> 04:42:17,120
At least I think I'm not going to lie. I

7122
04:42:15,920 --> 04:42:18,638
think you're still

7123
04:42:17,120 --> 04:42:20,240
No, no. I think the real reason is

7124
04:42:18,638 --> 04:42:22,080
you're still upset about the Azir and

7125
04:42:20,240 --> 04:42:24,400
the the Ary and Vi.

7126
04:42:22,080 --> 04:42:26,560
I mean, I I had kind of forgotten about

7127
04:42:24,400 --> 04:42:29,120
the draft. I just didn't remember what

7128
04:42:26,560 --> 04:42:31,760
the champions were by this stage. Is

7129
04:42:29,120 --> 04:42:33,120
that a happy birthday for for Sponge?

7130
04:42:31,760 --> 04:42:35,200
It looks like a happy birthday for

7131
04:42:33,120 --> 04:42:36,400
Sponge. The 25th.

7132
04:42:35,200 --> 04:42:39,120
Happy birthday, Sponge.

7133
04:42:36,400 --> 04:42:41,040
Happy birthday, Sponge. Well, the uh 200

7134
04:42:39,120 --> 04:42:43,440
for DRX could certainly be coming in.

7135
04:42:41,040 --> 04:42:46,718
Could happen.

7136
04:42:43,440 --> 04:42:49,120
Unless the fans on this side have their

7137
04:42:46,718 --> 04:42:53,120
phones out and are in Twitch chat

7138
04:42:49,120 --> 04:42:55,520
donating, right? Donating the Broax.

7139
04:42:53,120 --> 04:42:56,798
That's what you need to get in there. As

7140
04:42:55,520 --> 04:42:58,240
the guy in chat is actually currently

7141
04:42:56,798 --> 04:43:00,000
saying, "Atlas, start the game." All

7142
04:42:58,240 --> 04:43:00,400
right. Sorry, mate. I'm

7143
04:43:00,000 --> 04:43:01,920
Atlas.

7144
04:43:00,400 --> 04:43:02,400
It's my bad. It's my bad. I should

7145
04:43:01,920 --> 04:43:03,360
probably

7146
04:43:02,400 --> 04:43:04,878
He's currently leaving.

7147
04:43:03,360 --> 04:43:05,520
Yeah, I should probably pop. Just give

7148
04:43:04,878 --> 04:43:06,638
me give me

7149
04:43:05,520 --> 04:43:07,840
All right. He is actually

7150
04:43:06,638 --> 04:43:08,240
I'm heading out. I'm just gonna jump

7151
04:43:07,840 --> 04:43:09,920
over.

7152
04:43:08,240 --> 04:43:11,360
He is. No, no, no, no, no. Atlas. No,

7153
04:43:09,920 --> 04:43:13,200
no, no, no, no. Please, please, just

7154
04:43:11,360 --> 04:43:13,840
What do you mean? I need to go and start

7155
04:43:13,200 --> 04:43:15,680
the game.

7156
04:43:13,840 --> 04:43:16,320
You can't jump down there. That's

7157
04:43:15,680 --> 04:43:18,560
dangerous.

7158
04:43:16,320 --> 04:43:19,440
But I also I can't walk through hands

7159
04:43:18,560 --> 04:43:19,680
and everything. And there's a guy right

7160
04:43:19,440 --> 04:43:22,160
there.

7161
04:43:19,680 --> 04:43:22,718
Yes, you can. Just walk to the stage and

7162
04:43:22,160 --> 04:43:24,480
press the button.

7163
04:43:22,718 --> 04:43:26,080
I'm a very live person.

7164
04:43:24,480 --> 04:43:27,120
Don't I

7165
04:43:26,080 --> 04:43:30,958
I'm quite live.

7166
04:43:27,120 --> 04:43:33,040
Atlas. Atlas, I know you're a tall guy,

7167
04:43:30,958 --> 04:43:35,440
but just you you got to stay safe. Yeah,

7168
04:43:33,040 --> 04:43:37,760
I think you you're dramat dramatic.

7169
04:43:35,440 --> 04:43:39,280
Oh, I'm overly dramatic and very caring

7170
04:43:37,760 --> 04:43:42,080
and worrying about your wellbeing.

7171
04:43:39,280 --> 04:43:43,200
Oh, did you watch um the the the K-pop

7172
04:43:42,080 --> 04:43:44,638
Demon Hunters movie?

7173
04:43:43,200 --> 04:43:45,440
No, but I've heard it's amazing.

7174
04:43:44,638 --> 04:43:47,200
It's pretty good.

7175
04:43:45,440 --> 04:43:48,480
So, yeah, cuz I I have to watch it with

7176
04:43:47,200 --> 04:43:50,000
my wife and she's not here yet. She's

7177
04:43:48,480 --> 04:43:52,000
coming to Korea soon.

7178
04:43:50,000 --> 04:43:53,680
So, we're watching it together.

7179
04:43:52,000 --> 04:43:54,560
Uh I've heard it's it's it's fun.

7180
04:43:53,680 --> 04:43:57,520
It's pretty good.

7181
04:43:54,560 --> 04:44:00,320
It's pretty good. Um, I watched it in

7182
04:43:57,520 --> 04:44:03,040
Korean cuz I watched it with my wife and

7183
04:44:00,320 --> 04:44:04,718
it was really interesting because a lot

7184
04:44:03,040 --> 04:44:06,718
of the songs are in English, right? And

7185
04:44:04,718 --> 04:44:08,878
so I'm listening to the whole thing in

7186
04:44:06,718 --> 04:44:10,560
Korean and the Korean like translation's

7187
04:44:08,878 --> 04:44:11,920
actually super good like for like the

7188
04:44:10,560 --> 04:44:13,760
dubbing or whatever.

7189
04:44:11,920 --> 04:44:15,200
Um, but then they just all of a sudden

7190
04:44:13,760 --> 04:44:17,200
go into English and it's like for the

7191
04:44:15,200 --> 04:44:17,920
songs and it's just kind of odd.

7192
04:44:17,200 --> 04:44:19,200
Sounds weird.

7193
04:44:17,920 --> 04:44:21,360
Yeah. So I think I might just watch it

7194
04:44:19,200 --> 04:44:22,560
again just in English. See how that

7195
04:44:21,360 --> 04:44:24,560
goes. But do you know what we're going

7196
04:44:22,560 --> 04:44:27,440
to watch now? It's a game two between

7197
04:44:24,560 --> 04:44:32,200
the pros and DRX and the Azer on red

7198
04:44:27,440 --> 04:44:32,200
side somehow. Let's get onto the rift.

7199
04:44:42,610 --> 04:44:47,520
[Music]

7200
04:44:44,200 --> 04:44:50,400
[Applause]

7201
04:44:47,520 --> 04:44:52,400
All right. Well, I started the game and

7202
04:44:50,400 --> 04:44:54,080
thank you very much for the tax there as

7203
04:44:52,400 --> 04:44:56,480
well. There was some Atlas start the

7204
04:44:54,080 --> 04:44:59,200
game tax that was put in that, by the

7205
04:44:56,480 --> 04:45:01,120
way, guys, that goes straight to me and

7206
04:44:59,200 --> 04:45:02,878
not to the bros. So, you need to also

7207
04:45:01,120 --> 04:45:04,958
put your bro tax in

7208
04:45:02,878 --> 04:45:05,520
if you just let the Atlas start the

7209
04:45:04,958 --> 04:45:07,440
game.

7210
04:45:05,520 --> 04:45:09,680
You can't do that. It's a bro game.

7211
04:45:07,440 --> 04:45:12,320
That's That's bro tax. No, but like they

7212
04:45:09,680 --> 04:45:14,320
that was not they didn't, you know, do

7213
04:45:12,320 --> 04:45:16,000
the right channels to get it in there.

7214
04:45:14,320 --> 04:45:16,878
So, it went to the wrong place. Got to

7215
04:45:16,000 --> 04:45:18,320
make sure

7216
04:45:16,878 --> 04:45:18,878
donated

7217
04:45:18,320 --> 04:45:19,200
me.

7218
04:45:18,878 --> 04:45:21,520
Yeah,

7219
04:45:19,200 --> 04:45:24,160
I did already. I've double road tax.

7220
04:45:21,520 --> 04:45:25,600
Donate what the people gave to you to

7221
04:45:24,160 --> 04:45:27,360
bro.

7222
04:45:25,600 --> 04:45:27,680
Oh, like just like behind the scenes.

7223
04:45:27,360 --> 04:45:28,798
Yeah.

7224
04:45:27,680 --> 04:45:31,440
Oh, I could do that.

7225
04:45:28,798 --> 04:45:33,040
Please. But I mean I I do that anyway.

7226
04:45:31,440 --> 04:45:35,440
Atlas. Atlas, you're a good Okay, that's

7227
04:45:33,040 --> 04:45:36,638
true actually. Yeah, it'll it all comes

04:45:35,440 --> 04:45:40,080
up bro eventually.

7229
04:45:36,638 --> 04:45:44,120
Indeed. All roads lead to bro.

7230
04:45:40,080 --> 04:45:44,120
That's why they call them bros.

7231
04:45:45,680 --> 04:45:48,560
Still have two games left at you can't

7232
04:45:47,520 --> 04:45:51,120

04:46:08,958 --> 04:46:11,760
Yeah.

7244
04:46:09,440 --> 04:46:15,840
No, no, it's the opposite. I love MSI,

7245
04:46:11,760 --> 04:46:18,160
but for me, um, handle

7246
04:46:15,840 --> 04:46:19,760
I mean, I think that's I think that's n

7247
04:46:18,160 --> 04:46:21,440
with the level up, it's not it's not

7248
04:46:19,760 --> 04:46:24,480
Yeah, that that was a short shot too

7249
04:46:21,440 --> 04:46:27,760
many. Um, no. So

7250
04:46:24,480 --> 04:46:29,520
really, when it comes to adrenaline and

7251
04:46:27,760 --> 04:46:30,798
how memorable the games are, obviously

7252
04:46:29,520 --> 04:46:33,120
you can't beat an international

7253
04:46:30,798 --> 04:46:34,718
tournament. But when it comes to pure

7254
04:46:33,120 --> 04:46:36,798
enjoyment,

7255
04:46:34,718 --> 04:46:38,878
there is just not a lot of stuff that's

7256
04:46:36,798 --> 04:46:40,080
as fun as just having an LCK series

7257
04:46:38,878 --> 04:46:40,958
where you're just hanging out with the

7258
04:46:40,080 --> 04:46:42,638
gang,

7259
04:46:40,958 --> 04:46:44,400
where you're just enjoying yourself.

7260
04:46:42,638 --> 04:46:46,000
It's a very different thing, isn't it?

7261
04:46:44,400 --> 04:46:47,360
It's not It's actually not the same. I

7262
04:46:46,000 --> 04:46:49,680
feel like they're very different skill

7263
04:46:47,360 --> 04:46:50,878
sets because for for obviously, you

7264
04:46:49,680 --> 04:46:52,480
know, you have to you have to be

7265
04:46:50,878 --> 04:46:53,840
serious. You have to remind people that

7266
04:46:52,480 --> 04:46:54,480
the stakes. You have to actually look at

7267
04:46:53,840 --> 04:46:55,280
the game.

7268
04:46:54,480 --> 04:46:57,040
Yeah.

7269
04:46:55,280 --> 04:46:57,600
And now we don't have any of that

7270
04:46:57,040 --> 04:46:59,200
weighing.

7271
04:46:57,600 --> 04:47:01,920
I mean, there are there are some there's

7272
04:46:59,200 --> 04:47:04,320
some stake stakes.

7273
04:47:01,920 --> 04:47:08,240
How does this keep happening to you? I

7274
04:47:04,320 --> 04:47:09,600
don't know. It's it's a day got on red

7275
04:47:08,240 --> 04:47:10,080
side. Okay. And I don't I just don't

7276
04:47:09,600 --> 04:47:12,000
know how to call.

7277
04:47:10,080 --> 04:47:13,520
I lost. I need you. You don't need to t

7278
04:47:12,000 --> 04:47:14,400
It's fine. I know Azir was really

7279
04:47:13,520 --> 04:47:17,520
strong, but you can't

7280
04:47:14,400 --> 04:47:18,160
I mean it is Ari and it is closer

7281
04:47:17,520 --> 04:47:20,400
Crocco.

7282
04:47:18,160 --> 04:47:22,320
Yeah. And I mean, this is one of

7283
04:47:20,400 --> 04:47:24,560
Crocco's greatest picks in the past. So

7284
04:47:22,320 --> 04:47:25,600
maybe still has a massive amount of

7285
04:47:24,560 --> 04:47:27,520
confidence on it.

7286
04:47:25,600 --> 04:47:29,040
But Sponge is also very happy to be the

7287
04:47:27,520 --> 04:47:30,798
troll king

7288
04:47:29,040 --> 04:47:32,160
as Xandel doesn't get stunned up because

7289
04:47:30,798 --> 04:47:33,520
that mystic shot misses.

7290
04:47:32,160 --> 04:47:35,360
Oh my god.

7291
04:47:33,520 --> 04:47:36,958
The angle. Yeah, Hype just going to have

7292
04:47:35,360 --> 04:47:40,080
to flash. But now Sponge, he can just

7293
04:47:36,958 --> 04:47:42,958
flash in and chomp him. Oh no. Oh no. Oh

7294
04:47:40,080 --> 04:47:45,120
no. The troll was under the bridge. And

7295
04:47:42,958 --> 04:47:47,760
he's just, as I said, he didn't even

7296
04:47:45,120 --> 04:47:49,920
need to flash in. He just chomped him.

7297
04:47:47,760 --> 04:47:53,200
And that was it. Now Polo just has to

7298
04:47:49,920 --> 04:47:55,600
watch as he also gets chomped and no one

7299
04:47:53,200 --> 04:47:57,520
even dies. It's a gorgeous, gorgeous

7300
04:47:55,600 --> 04:48:00,400
dive. And Rich also survives on the top

7301
04:47:57,520 --> 04:48:04,958
side. Crocco getting cooked. And my god,

7302
04:48:00,400 --> 04:48:07,280
DRX may just obliterate the Bros. They

7303
04:48:04,958 --> 04:48:09,840
will at least in this early game, Atlas,

7304
04:48:07,280 --> 04:48:12,718
cuz that's a disaster.

7305
04:48:09,840 --> 04:48:14,160
Early kill for Teddy.

7306
04:48:12,718 --> 04:48:17,760
Sponge getting the follow-up kill.

7307
04:48:14,160 --> 04:48:19,760
Apollo as well. experience gap secured a

7308
04:48:17,760 --> 04:48:23,920
full level by the way cuz that was on

7309
04:48:19,760 --> 04:48:26,320
the crash and this is very elementary

7310
04:48:23,920 --> 04:48:28,160
stuff. If you are weak sided you can't

7311
04:48:26,320 --> 04:48:30,718
be going up for these trades. You just

7312
04:48:28,160 --> 04:48:32,480
can't. This is a much harder dive. Pipe

7313
04:48:30,718 --> 04:48:36,080
doesn't literally just die off of a

7314
04:48:32,480 --> 04:48:37,680
single auto by the Trundle. They Apollo

7315
04:48:36,080 --> 04:48:38,798
because he doesn't have anyone to help

7316
04:48:37,680 --> 04:48:40,400
him stack.

7317
04:48:38,798 --> 04:48:41,360
Oh man, the fact that Angel survived

7318
04:48:40,400 --> 04:48:43,520
there as well is

7319
04:48:41,360 --> 04:48:45,680
so big. It's not even insult to injury.

7320
04:48:43,520 --> 04:48:47,760
might just be backbreaking, but we'll

7321
04:48:45,680 --> 04:48:49,680
see. Of course, it is very early. Bit of

7322
04:48:47,760 --> 04:48:52,320
hyperbole here from good old Atlas, but

7323
04:48:49,680 --> 04:48:54,080
we'll see how they're going to recover

7324
04:48:52,320 --> 04:48:57,040
as maybe this is all part of the game

7325
04:48:54,080 --> 04:49:00,160
plan because in one Bro had a great

7326
04:48:57,040 --> 04:49:02,400
start and you saw how that ended. Now,

7327
04:49:00,160 --> 04:49:04,480
what Juke has said is no guys, great

7328
04:49:02,400 --> 04:49:06,560
starts are not what we want. We want a

7329
04:49:04,480 --> 04:49:08,638
terrible start. That's what's going to

7330
04:49:06,560 --> 04:49:10,560
get us. Okay, but but how does that

7331
04:49:08,638 --> 04:49:13,440
relate to the law of sponge where if

7332
04:49:10,560 --> 04:49:14,240
Sponge pops off, he will continue to pop

7333
04:49:13,440 --> 04:49:17,120
off?

7334
04:49:14,240 --> 04:49:20,320
The spongiest meme like he just isn't

7335
04:49:17,120 --> 04:49:22,560
one that can actually be understood.

7336
04:49:20,320 --> 04:49:25,040
That's that's the way I think about it.

7337
04:49:22,560 --> 04:49:25,600
It it he is Lord Spong. We know what he

7338
04:49:25,040 --> 04:49:26,000
does

7339
04:49:25,600 --> 04:49:29,840
indeed.

7340
04:49:26,000 --> 04:49:31,760
Well, sometimes I I I don't Okay, let me

7341
04:49:29,840 --> 04:49:34,080
troll king and he is one and I'm a

7342
04:49:31,760 --> 04:49:35,840
little bit worried about that. in a game

7343
04:49:34,080 --> 04:49:37,920
before a game. I never know what Sponge

7344
04:49:35,840 --> 04:49:40,240
does. But if Sponge is winning, I do

7345
04:49:37,920 --> 04:49:41,760
think generally he just keeps winning.

7346
04:49:40,240 --> 04:49:43,200
When he's losing, I think he keeps

7347
04:49:41,760 --> 04:49:44,320
losing. I don't think he's a he's a

7348
04:49:43,200 --> 04:49:45,200
combat guy.

7349
04:49:44,320 --> 04:49:47,120
That's a good point.

7350
04:49:45,200 --> 04:49:48,638
But when he's playing from ahead, I

7351
04:49:47,120 --> 04:49:50,480
think he is a little dangerous. We'll

7352
04:49:48,638 --> 04:49:52,798
see though. Closer and Kle have a lot of

7353
04:49:50,480 --> 04:49:55,360
playmaking potential. And he is trying

7354
04:49:52,798 --> 04:49:57,840
to sneak in here.

7355
04:49:55,360 --> 04:49:59,920
Oh, just on the edge of vision.

7356
04:49:57,840 --> 04:50:01,920
Yeah, not quite able to sneak into that

7357
04:49:59,920 --> 04:50:05,280
brush. He doesn't have Yeah, he has to

7358
04:50:01,920 --> 04:50:07,440
cuz he doesn't have flash or six. So,

7359
04:50:05,280 --> 04:50:08,878
oh, that is costly.

7360
04:50:07,440 --> 04:50:10,400
Level six is at least gained here for

7361
04:50:08,878 --> 04:50:13,200
Morgan. Does have that world ender back

7362
04:50:10,400 --> 04:50:14,798
up and hype and Polo just doing the very

7363
04:50:13,200 --> 04:50:17,840
best to catch waves underneath this

7364
04:50:14,798 --> 04:50:22,240
turret as Teddy lining a whole bunch of

7365
04:50:17,840 --> 04:50:25,520
these piercing lights onto Polo helping

7366
04:50:22,240 --> 04:50:27,760
soften up this Braum.

7367
04:50:25,520 --> 04:50:29,200
Shots going ary and it's looking a

7368
04:50:27,760 --> 04:50:30,480
little bit rough still. It's not exactly

7369
04:50:29,200 --> 04:50:31,680
end of the world as far as CS is

7370
04:50:30,480 --> 04:50:35,040
concerned and things like that. He's

7371
04:50:31,680 --> 04:50:36,878
only down about a wave. Uh is hype. So

7372
04:50:35,040 --> 04:50:39,200
that is going to alleviate if he can

7373
04:50:36,878 --> 04:50:40,958
stay competitive.

7374
04:50:39,200 --> 04:50:43,120
But mid lane extraordinarily even, top

7375
04:50:40,958 --> 04:50:45,440
lane extraordinarily even. And it's all

7376
04:50:43,120 --> 04:50:47,600
just the jungle and bot lane gaps that

7377
04:50:45,440 --> 04:50:49,680
are really starting to protrude here.

7378
04:50:47,600 --> 04:50:51,520
Oh, Ko getting invaded.

7379
04:50:49,680 --> 04:50:52,958
Yeah, problematic as that is a really

7380
04:50:51,520 --> 04:50:53,680
nice winter bite to spot out exactly

7381
04:50:52,958 --> 04:50:56,080
where Andal is.

7382
04:50:53,680 --> 04:50:58,480
Still level five.

7383
04:50:56,080 --> 04:51:00,560
Yeah, teleport. No, not a teleport. That

7384
04:50:58,480 --> 04:51:02,080
is a back. That's um that's less

7385
04:51:00,560 --> 04:51:04,080
aggressive.

7386
04:51:02,080 --> 04:51:06,080
A little bit unfortunate here for the

7387
04:51:04,080 --> 04:51:07,760
Bros as they will lose their red buff.

7388
04:51:06,080 --> 04:51:09,520
Crocco.

7389
04:51:07,760 --> 04:51:13,958
Yeah, it's uh feels like a race to level

7390
04:51:09,520 --> 04:51:13,958
six as the VI and he lost.

7391
04:51:16,080 --> 04:51:18,958
Yeah, I got I got nothing more. He will

7392
04:51:17,680 --> 04:51:20,160
be able to hit it off of but like look

7393
04:51:18,958 --> 04:51:21,520
at the vision control. He's not going to

7394
04:51:20,160 --> 04:51:23,920
be able to punish this bot lane

7395
04:51:21,520 --> 04:51:26,480
whatsoever.

7396
04:51:23,920 --> 04:51:28,958
And DRX a bit of an early game master

7397
04:51:26,480 --> 04:51:31,200
class. We kind of questioned Unil, but

7398
04:51:28,958 --> 04:51:33,440
it was his early trades

7399
04:51:31,200 --> 04:51:36,080
that set up the dive and they got both

7400
04:51:33,440 --> 04:51:38,160
kills off of a very clean setup with

7401
04:51:36,080 --> 04:51:40,160
Unil living. Sponge and Teddy both

7402
04:51:38,160 --> 04:51:42,718
picking up a kill.

7403
04:51:40,160 --> 04:51:44,320
And now the continued invading.

7404
04:51:42,718 --> 04:51:45,680
Brok I think needs to make this gank

7405
04:51:44,320 --> 04:51:46,958
work. They need to find something on

7406
04:51:45,680 --> 04:51:49,360
Rich.

7407
04:51:46,958 --> 04:51:50,160
Guess what? Rich, he's looking for a bit

7408
04:51:49,360 --> 04:51:51,600
of a back angle.

7409
04:51:50,160 --> 04:51:53,760
Oh, yep. There you go.

7410
04:51:51,600 --> 04:51:55,280
That's going to spot him out. So this

7411
04:51:53,760 --> 04:51:56,958
ward gives them all the information that

7412
04:51:55,280 --> 04:51:58,878
they need. Looks like Crocco might be

7413
04:51:56,958 --> 04:52:00,000
able to make his way over to some grubs,

7414
04:51:58,878 --> 04:52:01,440
but you can see the pings are coming

7415
04:52:00,000 --> 04:52:03,440
through from Sponge as well. That would

7416
04:52:01,440 --> 04:52:05,200
not be uncontested.

7417
04:52:03,440 --> 04:52:06,638
And so slinking back into his jungle.

7418
04:52:05,200 --> 04:52:08,400
Crocco just kind of licking his wounds

7419
04:52:06,638 --> 04:52:12,160
at this point. Teleport is going to

7420
04:52:08,400 --> 04:52:13,680
bring Andel towards the top side.

7421
04:52:12,160 --> 04:52:15,040
And they'll clear out some vision, make

7422
04:52:13,680 --> 04:52:16,638
sure that these grubs are going to be as

7423
04:52:15,040 --> 04:52:18,638
safe as possible. Yeah, with control of

7424
04:52:16,638 --> 04:52:21,360
mid lane and there is no contesting

7425
04:52:18,638 --> 04:52:23,520
this. So DRX have so far just controlled

7426
04:52:21,360 --> 04:52:25,520
everything on the map. And when you're

7427
04:52:23,520 --> 04:52:27,520
behind with your VR rec composition, it

7428
04:52:25,520 --> 04:52:30,480
just kind of falls flat, right? You need

7429
04:52:27,520 --> 04:52:32,080
to be able to actually find a target.

7430
04:52:30,480 --> 04:52:33,200
Going ham is Oh, good charm.

7431
04:52:32,080 --> 04:52:34,480
Yeah, decent charm. But the Empress

7432
04:52:33,200 --> 04:52:36,160
provider is still going to connect this

7433
04:52:34,480 --> 04:52:37,440
time. At least the box fire and the

7434
04:52:36,160 --> 04:52:38,400
sorry, the spirit rush is going to be

7435
04:52:37,440 --> 04:52:39,440
able to get him out of the way of

7436
04:52:38,400 --> 04:52:41,600
Vandal.

7437
04:52:39,440 --> 04:52:43,200
But that's still a win for the Rex. The

7438
04:52:41,600 --> 04:52:45,840
RX are looking at this going, "Okay,

7439
04:52:43,200 --> 04:52:47,440
Ariel means there's no window." Look at

7440
04:52:45,840 --> 04:52:50,718
the vision control as well. like yes

7441
04:52:47,440 --> 04:52:52,240
that is pink but even then I'm pretty

7442
04:52:50,718 --> 04:52:53,760
sure they knew cuz Krocco was on the top

7443
04:52:52,240 --> 04:52:55,200
side. Look at the vision that's there in

7444
04:52:53,760 --> 04:52:56,638
this top side jungle and before it was

7445
04:52:55,200 --> 04:52:59,840
in the bot side. They've been tracking

7446
04:52:56,638 --> 04:53:02,160
Krocco from the very beginning and with

7447
04:52:59,840 --> 04:53:04,560
Kroco not being able to make an impact

7448
04:53:02,160 --> 04:53:07,040
because he's being tracked. The lanes

7449
04:53:04,560 --> 04:53:08,638
are really struggling as DRX the solo

7450
04:53:07,040 --> 04:53:10,400
laners doing a good job. bot lane we

7451
04:53:08,638 --> 04:53:12,160
already talked about

7452
04:53:10,400 --> 04:53:14,560
and it doesn't really get better from

7453
04:53:12,160 --> 04:53:16,240
here, right? With the Azir on the map,

7454
04:53:14,560 --> 04:53:17,920
the fact that Trundle scales perfectly

7455
04:53:16,240 --> 04:53:19,760
into the later stages. Doesn't exactly

7456
04:53:17,920 --> 04:53:22,160
have the greatest of subjugate targets,

7457
04:53:19,760 --> 04:53:24,160
but it's not really that much of a

7458
04:53:22,160 --> 04:53:25,840
problem if you can just control your

7459
04:53:24,160 --> 04:53:27,920
opposition. And in the 1 v one against

7460
04:53:25,840 --> 04:53:31,360
Crocco, he didn't even need a lead like

7461
04:53:27,920 --> 04:53:33,840
this to have a very good time. It would

7462
04:53:31,360 --> 04:53:38,560
be very funny if Dx like some are two

7463
04:53:33,840 --> 04:53:41,200
zero, but the Sier just doesn't matter.

7464
04:53:38,560 --> 04:53:44,160
Well, Morgan does find a world well

7465
04:53:41,200 --> 04:53:45,840
world ender angle and Sponge gives up on

7466
04:53:44,160 --> 04:53:47,840
the opportunity here. Does just throw

7467
04:53:45,840 --> 04:53:49,200
down a pillar and realizes that he's a

7468
04:53:47,840 --> 04:53:52,240
little bit too close to the turret. They

7469
04:53:49,200 --> 04:53:55,440
don't exactly have hard CC.

7470
04:53:52,240 --> 04:53:57,040
So, he's allowed to live for the minute.

7471
04:53:55,440 --> 04:53:58,400
Slight advantage as well as far as CS

7472
04:53:57,040 --> 04:54:00,878
like Morgan and Clos are at least

7473
04:53:58,400 --> 04:54:02,798
farming well. And you can see the money

7474
04:54:00,878 --> 04:54:05,120
as far as the solo lanes concerned is

7475
04:54:02,798 --> 04:54:06,878
fine for the bros. It's just elsewhere.

7476
04:54:05,120 --> 04:54:09,120
It's kind of going catastrophically

7477
04:54:06,878 --> 04:54:10,958
wrong.

7478
04:54:09,120 --> 04:54:13,280
Early drake,

7479
04:54:10,958 --> 04:54:15,440
triple grubs as well for DRX. So,

7480
04:54:13,280 --> 04:54:18,958
they're feeling great. The only thing I

7481
04:54:15,440 --> 04:54:22,080
am a little worried about is that when

7482
04:54:18,958 --> 04:54:23,520
it comes to setup, they are relying on

7483
04:54:22,080 --> 04:54:25,600
And they'll be in there. Without him, I

7484
04:54:23,520 --> 04:54:26,080
think their CC is pretty lackluster.

7485
04:54:25,600 --> 04:54:27,680
Yep.

7486
04:54:26,080 --> 04:54:30,400
You're really only looking at a shuffle

7487
04:54:27,680 --> 04:54:31,440
and a pillar. Now I love Trundle pillar

7488
04:54:30,400 --> 04:54:34,160
but

7489
04:54:31,440 --> 04:54:36,958
into the enemy team like how good is it

7490
04:54:34,160 --> 04:54:38,240
really? Yeah, it's not amazing when it's

7491
04:54:36,958 --> 04:54:40,160
alone, you know.

7492
04:54:38,240 --> 04:54:43,200
It's well that, but there's also there

7493
04:54:40,160 --> 04:54:43,760
is u what is it? Um dash.

7494
04:54:43,200 --> 04:54:46,400
Y

7495
04:54:43,760 --> 04:54:47,920
there is a vault breaker

7496
04:54:46,400 --> 04:54:49,440
obviously.

7497
04:54:47,920 --> 04:54:51,280
Stand beside me.

7498
04:54:49,440 --> 04:54:54,958
There you go.

7499
04:54:51,280 --> 04:54:56,958
Stand beside me or stand beside Brock.

7500
04:54:54,958 --> 04:54:59,840
He says stand behind Bra.

7501
04:54:56,958 --> 04:55:02,000
But it is stand. Well, it makes sense

7502
04:54:59,840 --> 04:55:03,440
cuz it wouldn't It'd be weird if the

7503
04:55:02,000 --> 04:55:05,280
name was

7504
04:55:03,440 --> 04:55:06,240
Yeah, I think we're supposed to say

7505
04:55:05,280 --> 04:55:08,400
Braum.

7506
04:55:06,240 --> 04:55:08,718
But if you're playing Braum, you can say

7507
04:55:08,400 --> 04:55:10,958
me.

7508
04:55:08,718 --> 04:55:12,080
Well, he still says Braum, though. Like,

7509
04:55:10,958 --> 04:55:13,200
he talks about himself in the third

7510
04:55:12,080 --> 04:55:15,600
person. That's kind of weird.

7511
04:55:13,200 --> 04:55:18,080
Do that. It is kind of weird. Atlas does

7512
04:55:15,600 --> 04:55:19,120
that too sometimes.

7513
04:55:18,080 --> 04:55:21,200
Yeah, I don't like that.

7514
04:55:19,120 --> 04:55:23,200
Yeah, I know. Neither do I. Okay. Um,

7515
04:55:21,200 --> 04:55:24,798
what does Atlas think about it?

7516
04:55:23,200 --> 04:55:27,200
He loves it.

7517
04:55:24,798 --> 04:55:29,680
Uh, second drake being contested here.

7518
04:55:27,200 --> 04:55:32,160
Look at the item finishes. Item done for

7519
04:55:29,680 --> 04:55:34,240
Sponge. Item done for Teddy as well as

7520
04:55:32,160 --> 04:55:35,680
Rich sitting on a Yeah, they can contest

7521
04:55:34,240 --> 04:55:38,320
this. I think they made the right call.

7522
04:55:35,680 --> 04:55:40,718
But you are VI and Ari

7523
04:55:38,320 --> 04:55:42,240
and you're not contesting Drakes. You're

7524
04:55:40,718 --> 04:55:43,440
down to

7525
04:55:42,240 --> 04:55:45,600
And that is going to be feats of

7526
04:55:43,440 --> 04:55:46,798
strength. Objectives are concerned. And

7527
04:55:45,600 --> 04:55:48,400
there is another mountain. We are

7528
04:55:46,798 --> 04:55:51,680
inundated with mountains.

7529
04:55:48,400 --> 04:55:54,718
Is anything more bro than beating DK and

7530
04:55:51,680 --> 04:55:56,878
then just getting two zero by BRX?

7531
04:55:54,718 --> 04:55:59,360
Nope. That is about as bro as you can

7532
04:55:56,878 --> 04:56:00,480
get. And do you know what it is?

7533
04:55:59,360 --> 04:56:02,400
It's a lack of brok.

7534
04:56:00,480 --> 04:56:03,840
It's just everyone lost all of their bro

7535
04:56:02,400 --> 04:56:05,200
tags.

7536
04:56:03,840 --> 04:56:08,958
The people are struggling.

7537
04:56:05,200 --> 04:56:11,680
They should have got all of their brok

7538
04:56:08,958 --> 04:56:13,840
the the the committed like uh the the

7539
04:56:11,680 --> 04:56:15,600
the bro predictors.

7540
04:56:13,840 --> 04:56:18,718
They would have been like rolling in the

7541
04:56:15,600 --> 04:56:21,120
cash after, you know, they they they

7542
04:56:18,718 --> 04:56:23,360
picked up the win against DK. Like the

7543
04:56:21,120 --> 04:56:26,160
channel points should be there.

7544
04:56:23,360 --> 04:56:28,240
Should be flowing. Oh dear.

7545
04:56:26,160 --> 04:56:29,680
It's fine. It's only a 1.2k gold lead. I

7546
04:56:28,240 --> 04:56:31,920
do think the game state is getting worse

7547
04:56:29,680 --> 04:56:32,240
for Bro, but let's not pretend that the

7548
04:56:31,920 --> 04:56:35,920
RX

7549
04:56:32,240 --> 04:56:40,240
It's never too late for more Broex.

7550
04:56:35,920 --> 04:56:43,120
There is always a way, you know, as it

7551
04:56:40,240 --> 04:56:44,798
it might be tough for the Lord, who I

7552
04:56:43,120 --> 04:56:46,400
think knows that things are getting a

7553
04:56:44,798 --> 04:56:48,480
little bit rough as they do move their

7554
04:56:46,400 --> 04:56:50,160
way in. Flash still available, but he

7555
04:56:48,480 --> 04:56:52,718
decides he wants to use that next time

7556
04:56:50,160 --> 04:56:55,280
because he was looking pretty dead. And

7557
04:56:52,718 --> 04:56:56,400
it's just going DRX to DRX. That is

7558
04:56:55,280 --> 04:56:59,760
going to be feats of strength. Some

7559
04:56:56,400 --> 04:57:02,240
upgraded shoes now available here. And

7560
04:56:59,760 --> 04:57:04,320
the Bros looking just kind of worse for

7561
04:57:02,240 --> 04:57:08,000
wear.

7562
04:57:04,320 --> 04:57:10,080
DRX making good use it looks like of the

7563
04:57:08,000 --> 04:57:12,320
time that they spent.

7564
04:57:10,080 --> 04:57:17,080
Just we've got a new one. We've got

7565
04:57:12,320 --> 04:57:17,080
Atlas. Stop blaming chat attacks.

7566
04:57:17,360 --> 04:57:19,360
I don't know where that one goes.

7567
04:57:18,718 --> 04:57:20,240
No, that's good.

7568
04:57:19,360 --> 04:57:20,958
That's a good one.

7569
04:57:20,240 --> 04:57:22,240
That's good.

7570
04:57:20,958 --> 04:57:24,320
I'm sorry. Sorry, I'll stop blaming

7571
04:57:22,240 --> 04:57:26,958
chat, but that was very good.

7572
04:57:24,320 --> 04:57:28,320
That is the core of many bro memes. He

7573
04:57:26,958 --> 04:57:30,000
will not chat. Don't let him get away

7574
04:57:28,320 --> 04:57:32,080
with it. I love this actually.

7575
04:57:30,000 --> 04:57:34,160
Accountability for Atlas.

7576
04:57:32,080 --> 04:57:36,080
Okay, I apologize. However, you still do

7577
04:57:34,160 --> 04:57:38,080
need to pay your bro.

7578
04:57:36,080 --> 04:57:41,040
No, it's you and you and Ox are both the

7579
04:57:38,080 --> 04:57:43,840
the kings of getting as much Brot tax as

7580
04:57:41,040 --> 04:57:44,400
possible. Accountability for Aux as

7581
04:57:43,840 --> 04:57:46,080
well.

7582
04:57:44,400 --> 04:57:48,638
Well, I mean, it's just you just got to

7583
04:57:46,080 --> 04:57:50,160
pay Broax, man. It's I'm not the

7584
04:57:48,638 --> 04:57:52,080
government. No, I am I'm going to

7585
04:57:50,160 --> 04:57:54,080
question I want to question why why are

7586
04:57:52,080 --> 04:57:54,400
we paying our bro tax? Why do we need to

7587
04:57:54,080 --> 04:57:56,638
do this?

7588
04:57:54,400 --> 04:57:58,878
So that the bros can stand a chance.

7589
04:57:56,638 --> 04:58:00,320
Well, but if I've been paying for Broax

7590
04:57:58,878 --> 04:58:01,200
and I'm not seeing any of that in the

7591
04:58:00,320 --> 04:58:03,040
pro performance,

7592
04:58:01,200 --> 04:58:04,240
but it would have been way worse if they

7593
04:58:03,040 --> 04:58:06,000
hadn't paid any protag.

7594
04:58:04,240 --> 04:58:06,718
Well, you got evidence of that.

7595
04:58:06,000 --> 04:58:08,638
No.

7596
04:58:06,718 --> 04:58:09,280
Well, then why are you making these

7597
04:58:08,638 --> 04:58:10,878
claims?

7598
04:58:09,280 --> 04:58:12,718
If I could travel to a different

7599
04:58:10,878 --> 04:58:13,440
dimension, I might be able to prove. But

7600
04:58:12,718 --> 04:58:14,480
I can't.

7601
04:58:13,440 --> 04:58:16,240
Oh, we're not even doing a little

7602
04:58:14,480 --> 04:58:18,638
timeline hop. We're not doing a little

7603
04:58:16,240 --> 04:58:20,080
multiverse. No, because everyone loses

7604
04:58:18,638 --> 04:58:23,280
interest. As soon as you bring in

7605
04:58:20,080 --> 04:58:24,400
multiverses, no one cares anymore. Okay,

7606
04:58:23,280 --> 04:58:25,360
we don't have time.

7607
04:58:24,400 --> 04:58:26,878
Nothing matters.

7608
04:58:25,360 --> 04:58:28,878
We don't have time to talk about the

7609
04:58:26,878 --> 04:58:30,718
fact that if there is no causality,

7610
04:58:28,878 --> 04:58:32,798
nothing matters. Atlas, there are

7611
04:58:30,718 --> 04:58:34,320
stakes. You said it many times.

7612
04:58:32,798 --> 04:58:36,080
No, we were talking about dinner,

7613
04:58:34,320 --> 04:58:36,480
weren't we? I said that there wasn't any

7614
04:58:36,080 --> 04:58:38,320
steak.

7615
04:58:36,480 --> 04:58:39,920
No, we were talking about vampire

7616
04:58:38,320 --> 04:58:42,080
stakes.

7617
04:58:39,920 --> 04:58:44,560
I forgot. Oh, now we're back to Leslie

7618
04:58:42,080 --> 04:58:46,000
and I'm feeling way better. Okay, Andel

7619
04:58:44,560 --> 04:58:47,360
and uh Teddy are looking for a little

7620
04:58:46,000 --> 04:58:51,200
bit of an angle here. I don't know why

7621
04:58:47,360 --> 04:58:53,360
we're we're doing some uh K River,

7622
04:58:51,200 --> 04:58:55,440
but uh we are going to move back to the

7623
04:58:53,360 --> 04:58:57,760
A ramming. We were river ramming for a

7624
04:58:55,440 --> 04:58:59,520
moment, which is some pretty crazy

7625
04:58:57,760 --> 04:59:01,360
territory.

7626
04:58:59,520 --> 04:59:03,440
We're going to get a Herald fight. I if

7627
04:59:01,360 --> 04:59:05,520
bro lose this fight, I think it's done.

7628
04:59:03,440 --> 04:59:07,840
They need to find good target selection.

7629
04:59:05,520 --> 04:59:09,040
Well, Crocco is just going in. He

7630
04:59:07,840 --> 04:59:11,200
flashes out of the way of the solar

7631
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:12,798
flare and finds Yahoo. Closer is there

7632
04:59:11,200 --> 04:59:14,240
as well. They manage to land the char.

7633
04:59:12,798 --> 04:59:16,958
True shot barrage is going to be able to

7634
04:59:14,240 --> 04:59:20,480
take down the Azir. And now Morgan is

7635
04:59:16,958 --> 04:59:24,160
going to end TRX's world as he takes

7636
04:59:20,480 --> 04:59:28,080
down Andel. There goes Rich as well.

7637
04:59:24,160 --> 04:59:31,520
Thank you for the protag chat. You guys

7638
04:59:28,080 --> 04:59:34,798
did this. This is you

7639
04:59:31,520 --> 04:59:38,480
as the target selection

7640
04:59:34,798 --> 04:59:42,400
of Crocco and Closer find. Yahoo. That

7641
04:59:38,480 --> 04:59:45,360
man did not get to play the video game.

7642
04:59:42,400 --> 04:59:49,120
And the turn around

7643
04:59:45,360 --> 04:59:52,718
that we all knew deep down was coming as

7644
04:59:49,120 --> 04:59:56,000
the Herald is taken. The mid lane turret

7645
04:59:52,718 --> 04:59:58,240
falls and bro is back on top. And you

7646
04:59:56,000 --> 05:00:01,200
don't need a multiverse anymore.

7647
04:59:58,240 --> 05:00:04,878
Chronicler, you know that it was that

7648
05:00:01,200 --> 05:00:08,920
influx of purple text

7649
05:00:04,878 --> 05:00:08,920
that allowed this to happen.

7650
05:00:09,840 --> 05:00:12,798
I don't know whether that's the case,

7651
05:00:10,958 --> 05:00:15,760
but bro are definitely back in it now.

7652
05:00:12,798 --> 05:00:17,920
They in fact have a 1,00 gold lead

7653
05:00:15,760 --> 05:00:20,000
again. Highlight here is the turn onto

7654
05:00:17,920 --> 05:00:22,160
Yahoo. So really good flash from Crocker

7655
05:00:20,000 --> 05:00:25,040
to ensure he doesn't get taken down by

7656
05:00:22,160 --> 05:00:27,680
the solar flare and then an entire open.

7657
05:00:25,040 --> 05:00:29,120
He goes into Paulo. Oh, okay. We are

7658
05:00:27,680 --> 05:00:31,440
back in the action once again. Emperence

7659
05:00:29,120 --> 05:00:34,400
divide is on too, but it is Andal that's

7660
05:00:31,440 --> 05:00:36,638
going down and Paulo just walks it off.

7661
05:00:34,400 --> 05:00:39,280
Close is going to turn off but DRX what

7662
05:00:36,638 --> 05:00:40,240
happened? as Teddy is actually kind of

7663
05:00:39,280 --> 05:00:42,400
popping off right now. But the

7664
05:00:40,240 --> 05:00:44,080
relentless pursuit to try and escape

7665
05:00:42,400 --> 05:00:47,440
is coming on through here. There is the

7666
05:00:44,080 --> 05:00:50,320
culling. That'll take down the Braum.

7667
05:00:47,440 --> 05:00:52,000
And it is a two for two in the end.

7668
05:00:50,320 --> 05:00:54,718
Guys, Drake is up. I feel like we have

7669
05:00:52,000 --> 05:00:56,480
more pressing. DRX could have just took

7670
05:00:54,718 --> 05:00:57,120
just take a drake. We could have got

7671
05:00:56,480 --> 05:00:58,240
soul point.

7672
05:00:57,120 --> 05:00:59,840
No, no, no, no, no.

7673
05:00:58,240 --> 05:01:01,280
Just take soul point.

7674
05:00:59,840 --> 05:01:02,080
There was hitting enemies to do

7675
05:01:01,280 --> 05:01:04,160
chronicler.

7676
05:01:02,080 --> 05:01:06,560
Uh, as we go for the dive as there are

7677
05:01:04,160 --> 05:01:08,320
many, many people on this. I didn't see

7678
05:01:06,560 --> 05:01:11,280
that solar flare cuz I think outside of

7679
05:01:08,320 --> 05:01:13,040
the replay off screen that was actually

7680
05:01:11,280 --> 05:01:14,878
he did travel to the multiverse. He was

7681
05:01:13,040 --> 05:01:15,520
hitting eight trucks in the other

7682
05:01:14,878 --> 05:01:18,160
timeline.

7683
05:01:15,520 --> 05:01:18,798
That was where

7684
05:01:18,160 --> 05:01:20,878
exactly.

7685
05:01:18,798 --> 05:01:23,360
Yeah. Okay. Before they got all of the

7686
05:01:20,878 --> 05:01:25,520
people back that Thanos did his cliff.

7687
05:01:23,360 --> 05:01:28,080
Not in this timeline though as clearly

7688
05:01:25,520 --> 05:01:30,240
didn't find the was ambitious dive

7689
05:01:28,080 --> 05:01:33,040
anyway. Uh what does it mean for the

7690
05:01:30,240 --> 05:01:34,400
fight? Closing those have his

7691
05:01:33,040 --> 05:01:36,638
that dragon that we were going to fight

7692
05:01:34,400 --> 05:01:38,400
over before. Rock is going to go in.

7693
05:01:36,638 --> 05:01:40,480
They are just looking to execute the

7694
05:01:38,400 --> 05:01:41,840
Trundle and they do exactly that. And

7695
05:01:40,480 --> 05:01:43,040
he's got the Eclipse running, but

7696
05:01:41,840 --> 05:01:45,760
where's the follow up? Where's the

7697
05:01:43,040 --> 05:01:48,160
answer? It's a double for Hype as

7698
05:01:45,760 --> 05:01:50,878
Yahoo's now just going to get stunned up

7699
05:01:48,160 --> 05:01:53,840
by the Braum passive. Teddy gets ceased

7700
05:01:50,878 --> 05:01:56,000
and desisted. Oh, assault and battery

7701
05:01:53,840 --> 05:01:58,958
was so much better for doing that. Um,

7702
05:01:56,000 --> 05:02:00,798
but he that is kind of what happened in

7703
05:01:58,958 --> 05:02:03,520
the end. And now it's a free dragon over

7704
05:02:00,798 --> 05:02:06,000
to the bros. They have full control.

7705
05:02:03,520 --> 05:02:08,878
This was all part of Juke's plan.

7706
05:02:06,000 --> 05:02:12,718
He warned him. He said early leads,

7707
05:02:08,878 --> 05:02:14,718
early leads are bait are killers.

7708
05:02:12,718 --> 05:02:16,798
Never have a lead early and everything

7709
05:02:14,718 --> 05:02:18,958
will be fine.

7710
05:02:16,798 --> 05:02:20,000
And you know what? Proof is in the

7711
05:02:18,958 --> 05:02:22,160
pudding, Chronicler.

7712
05:02:20,000 --> 05:02:23,520
So, engage onto Sponge, who I really

7713
05:02:22,160 --> 05:02:26,000
think should have just subjugated at the

7714
05:02:23,520 --> 05:02:27,760
start of this. Maybe could have lived.

7715
05:02:26,000 --> 05:02:29,600
But there's also the question, why are

7716
05:02:27,760 --> 05:02:31,920
we that far up when we don't have an

7717
05:02:29,600 --> 05:02:32,958
ultimate uh on the Azero? cuz if a zero

7718
05:02:31,920 --> 05:02:35,440
is an ultimate, they can't make that

7719
05:02:32,958 --> 05:02:37,280
play cuz they try to go that deep get

7720
05:02:35,440 --> 05:02:39,920
taken down. And then these segmented

7721
05:02:37,280 --> 05:02:41,200
plays where Morgan just gets the press

7722
05:02:39,920 --> 05:02:43,680
Q, they can't get the ST, the Braum

7723
05:02:41,200 --> 05:02:45,920
passive. It's one by one by one by one.

7724
05:02:43,680 --> 05:02:49,680
Obviously doing a lot better there.

7725
05:02:45,920 --> 05:02:51,520
Now DRX still in a playable spot in this

7726
05:02:49,680 --> 05:02:53,920
game. But

7727
05:02:51,520 --> 05:02:55,840
I mean, this is still a throwable.

7728
05:02:53,920 --> 05:02:56,638
Uh yes, for either side, which I do

7729
05:02:55,840 --> 05:02:58,320
appreciate

7730
05:02:56,638 --> 05:03:00,560
big time.

7731
05:02:58,320 --> 05:03:03,280
We're going to see that this goal graph

7732
05:03:00,560 --> 05:03:06,560
is precisely how it looked in the last

7733
05:03:03,280 --> 05:03:10,160
game, but the other side

7734
05:03:06,560 --> 05:03:13,120
like almost exactly. It's almost poetry.

7735
05:03:10,160 --> 05:03:14,718
It's beautiful

7736
05:03:13,120 --> 05:03:17,120
as Closer was unable to kill that

7737
05:03:14,718 --> 05:03:19,040
minion. Um, which is a bit awkward.

7738
05:03:17,120 --> 05:03:20,080
Poetry needs tension. Okay, Atlas. Not

7739
05:03:19,040 --> 05:03:21,600
everything is perfect.

7740
05:03:20,080 --> 05:03:23,840
Yeah, that's true. That's true. Light

7741
05:03:21,600 --> 05:03:28,080
and shade and stuff like that. It's it's

7742
05:03:23,840 --> 05:03:30,080
shades of gray, blah blah blah. Um, not

7743
05:03:28,080 --> 05:03:31,920
not a certain number of them. Okay. No,

7744
05:03:30,080 --> 05:03:33,120
that's it's the gray area.

7745
05:03:31,920 --> 05:03:33,680
They didn't they didn't even go there,

7746
05:03:33,120 --> 05:03:36,080
Atlas.

7747
05:03:33,680 --> 05:03:37,120
Oh, it's not in the It's not in the

7748
05:03:36,080 --> 05:03:38,718
zeitgeist anymore.

7749
05:03:37,120 --> 05:03:41,280
He scoffed. He scoffed.

7750
05:03:38,718 --> 05:03:42,878
Yeah. Just scoff at you trying to just

7751
05:03:41,280 --> 05:03:44,798
pilot your way for yet another

7752
05:03:42,878 --> 05:03:45,920
nonsensical allegory that we're trying

7753
05:03:44,798 --> 05:03:47,840
to make work.

7754
05:03:45,920 --> 05:03:50,000
Have you seen that there's an Australian

7755
05:03:47,840 --> 05:03:51,920
dude that just does really Australian

7756
05:03:50,000 --> 05:03:52,718
summaries of movies?

7757
05:03:51,920 --> 05:03:55,120
I have not.

7758
05:03:52,718 --> 05:03:56,400
There's a Twilight one. It's so good.

7759
05:03:55,120 --> 05:03:58,958
It's very funny.

7760
05:03:56,400 --> 05:04:00,320
My uh the person that was the best man I

7761
05:03:58,958 --> 05:04:01,360
went actually made me read all the

7762
05:04:00,320 --> 05:04:01,680
Twilight novels.

7763
05:04:01,360 --> 05:04:02,878
Really?

7764
05:04:01,680 --> 05:04:03,360
So I actually did read all of them.

7765
05:04:02,878 --> 05:04:05,120
Yeah.

7766
05:04:03,360 --> 05:04:08,000
Is that worse or is me reading them

7767
05:04:05,120 --> 05:04:09,440
twice on purpose? That as Sponge is

7768
05:04:08,000 --> 05:04:10,718
going to get taken down very low again,

7769
05:04:09,440 --> 05:04:12,080
but this time the subjugate is going to

7770
05:04:10,718 --> 05:04:14,718
be working out through barrage wasn't

7771
05:04:12,080 --> 05:04:17,120
enough. Oh, the door is there to answer

7772
05:04:14,718 --> 05:04:19,520
the Lucian as Closer was dashing over

7773
05:04:17,120 --> 05:04:22,240
but doesn't quite find a target. Getting

7774
05:04:19,520 --> 05:04:23,360
taken a little low, but looks like DRX

7775
05:04:22,240 --> 05:04:27,120
doesn't want to commit with their front

7776
05:04:23,360 --> 05:04:30,638
line. No, Rich. Uh, okay. Well, I guess

7777
05:04:27,120 --> 05:04:32,718
he had flash, but no longer. Hm. Well,

7778
05:04:30,638 --> 05:04:34,160
he's just going to go home. That was

7779
05:04:32,718 --> 05:04:36,240
weird. All right.

7780
05:04:34,160 --> 05:04:37,040
Wait, so so you just also read all of

7781
05:04:36,240 --> 05:04:39,360
them voluntarily?

7782
05:04:37,040 --> 05:04:41,040
Yeah, I did. As my uh one of my best

7783
05:04:39,360 --> 05:04:42,958
friends in uh high school was like,

7784
05:04:41,040 --> 05:04:43,520
"These these books are great." I was

7785
05:04:42,958 --> 05:04:45,280
like, "All right."

7786
05:04:43,520 --> 05:04:45,760
They there were, but I enjoyed it. It

7787
05:04:45,280 --> 05:04:48,320
was fun.

7788
05:04:45,760 --> 05:04:51,040
Yeah, it was a bit of a romp. Uh, you

7789
05:04:48,320 --> 05:04:51,840
know, I like vampires as we were talking

7790
05:04:51,040 --> 05:04:54,400
about in the previous video.

7791
05:04:51,840 --> 05:04:55,360
It did give us um Robert Patterson,

7792
05:04:54,400 --> 05:04:57,280
which

7793
05:04:55,360 --> 05:04:58,480
I mean, I don't think he needed the

7794
05:04:57,280 --> 05:05:00,240
whole Twilight thing, you know.

7795
05:04:58,480 --> 05:05:02,480
Well, no, but it definitely helped.

7796
05:05:00,240 --> 05:05:04,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

7797
05:05:02,480 --> 05:05:06,240
I think if we had have just been able to

7798
05:05:04,480 --> 05:05:06,958
like skip that bit though and just had

7799
05:05:06,240 --> 05:05:09,360
the Robert P.

7800
05:05:06,958 --> 05:05:12,480
No, I actually No, I actually think it

7801
05:05:09,360 --> 05:05:15,480
adds it adds character. It adds

7802
05:05:12,480 --> 05:05:15,480
character.

7803
05:05:15,680 --> 05:05:19,680
Oh, brilliant. Well, Derrick's doing

7804
05:05:17,280 --> 05:05:20,958
that start up.

7805
05:05:19,680 --> 05:05:22,480
How do we feel about this?

7806
05:05:20,958 --> 05:05:25,280
Well, we saw what it did for Row in the

7807
05:05:22,480 --> 05:05:27,360
last game, so I I I'm waiting with great

7808
05:05:25,280 --> 05:05:29,120
interest. Well, we are trueing and

7809
05:05:27,360 --> 05:05:31,040
barging. Bridge taking a bit of damage,

7810
05:05:29,120 --> 05:05:32,400
but it's Morgan in a bit of trouble.

7811
05:05:31,040 --> 05:05:34,160
Does find some knockups though, and

7812
05:05:32,400 --> 05:05:35,760
remember has a lot of healing. He goes

7813
05:05:34,160 --> 05:05:38,000
golden, but now closer is going to show

7814
05:05:35,760 --> 05:05:39,440
up. The equalizer does nothing. Teddy

7815
05:05:38,000 --> 05:05:40,878
trying to get out of the way of Polo,

7816
05:05:39,440 --> 05:05:43,600
but he should be able to get this one

7817
05:05:40,878 --> 05:05:45,280
done. It's a double as Teddy makes his

7818
05:05:43,600 --> 05:05:48,320
presence known. Ice charm will connect

7819
05:05:45,280 --> 05:05:52,160
but Andal back underneath that sundisk

7820
05:05:48,320 --> 05:05:54,638
and bro don't know about this one is

7821
05:05:52,160 --> 05:05:55,440
dead and sponge is still up so it's noon

7822
05:05:54,638 --> 05:05:59,600
now

7823
05:05:55,440 --> 05:06:01,040
just a two for two rich if he uh

7824
05:05:59,600 --> 05:06:02,718
positions his queue a little bit better

7825
05:06:01,040 --> 05:06:03,920
there with the arm guard I think he

7826
05:06:02,718 --> 05:06:05,120
could have actually cooked Morgan could

7827
05:06:03,920 --> 05:06:06,878
have been big cuz look at the damage

7828
05:06:05,120 --> 05:06:11,360
he's able to do here I think both his

7829
05:06:06,878 --> 05:06:12,958
old and his Q right there

7830
05:06:11,360 --> 05:06:15,520
timing a little better and he kills

7831
05:06:12,958 --> 05:06:18,798
Morgan and then Morgan to get the reset.

7832
05:06:15,520 --> 05:06:21,120
Uh closer also is able to get to the

7833
05:06:18,798 --> 05:06:23,600
rest of the fight, but it's a bit of a

7834
05:06:21,120 --> 05:06:26,400
mess as again these fights are so split

7835
05:06:23,600 --> 05:06:27,920
on either side. No one gets out of Khan.

7836
05:06:26,400 --> 05:06:29,920
So we look at what has actually been

7837
05:06:27,920 --> 05:06:32,958
used. So it's flash for Crocco, flash

7838
05:06:29,920 --> 05:06:34,718
for Paulo, flash for Yu as well. Uh and

7839
05:06:32,958 --> 05:06:36,560
R doesn't have his arm, which I think is

7840
05:06:34,718 --> 05:06:38,080
actually a big deal. As Ro are just

7841
05:06:36,560 --> 05:06:40,400
going to start it up again. I'm not so

7842
05:06:38,080 --> 05:06:43,600
sure about that, but there is no

7843
05:06:40,400 --> 05:06:44,480
equalizer right now available. and and I

7844
05:06:43,600 --> 05:06:46,400
might just have to get this.

7845
05:06:44,480 --> 05:06:48,638
I mean, there's actually there's no alts

7846
05:06:46,400 --> 05:06:50,400
apart from the uh the solar flare that's

7847
05:06:48,638 --> 05:06:52,798
coming up pretty soon. It is just gone.

7848
05:06:50,400 --> 05:06:56,718
So, the bros some highway robbery here

7849
05:06:52,798 --> 05:06:59,600
as the artic is going to be secured.

7850
05:06:56,718 --> 05:07:02,160
And that's a magis. Wow. Closer. Wow.

7851
05:06:59,600 --> 05:07:04,240
How can you be like I'm going to build a

7852
05:07:02,160 --> 05:07:04,638
banshees and a magis?

7853
05:07:04,240 --> 05:07:06,160
Well,

7854
05:07:04,638 --> 05:07:07,280
I feel like you've just that's like

7855
05:07:06,160 --> 05:07:08,638
multiple personalities.

7856
05:07:07,280 --> 05:07:11,040
No, no. There is a school of thought

7857
05:07:08,638 --> 05:07:12,958
that Magis or sorry Banshees allows you

7858
05:07:11,040 --> 05:07:14,480
to play more aggressively spell.

7859
05:07:12,958 --> 05:07:15,760
Oh, right. And that lets you hold on to

7860
05:07:14,480 --> 05:07:17,440
the stacks more effectively.

7861
05:07:15,760 --> 05:07:19,280
Well, that but also you can play more

7862
05:07:17,440 --> 05:07:20,638
aggressively into the opponents cuz you

7863
05:07:19,280 --> 05:07:21,040
can tank a skill.

7864
05:07:20,638 --> 05:07:22,878
True.

7865
05:07:21,040 --> 05:07:26,080
So like you can you can ult in more

7866
05:07:22,878 --> 05:07:27,440
aggressively because you're fine.

7867
05:07:26,080 --> 05:07:30,000
Well, we'll see whether that is going to

7868
05:07:27,440 --> 05:07:33,520
remain the case. So far 306 having a

7869
05:07:30,000 --> 05:07:34,560
very good time as Yahoo may discontinue

7870
05:07:33,520 --> 05:07:36,080
having a good time.

7871
05:07:34,560 --> 05:07:38,240
We're playing two sides of the map here.

7872
05:07:36,080 --> 05:07:38,638
This is risky from bro.

7873
05:07:38,240 --> 05:07:39,520
They are.

7874
05:07:38,638 --> 05:07:41,600
Yeah, I was about to say

7875
05:07:39,520 --> 05:07:43,760
on a dragon right now. That is going to

7876
05:07:41,600 --> 05:07:45,680
go down. But can they all get themselves

7877
05:07:43,760 --> 05:07:47,600
out?

7878
05:07:45,680 --> 05:07:49,600
Why did Why did we We did not need to

7879
05:07:47,600 --> 05:07:51,200
press the Q button.

7880
05:07:49,600 --> 05:07:52,638
Not going to move the wall.

7881
05:07:51,200 --> 05:07:53,760
He needed to kill actually needed to

7882
05:07:52,638 --> 05:07:55,680
kill it as soon as possible cuz he

7883
05:07:53,760 --> 05:07:58,480
didn't have smite. Oh,

7884
05:07:55,680 --> 05:08:00,320
so he did actually really want to try

7885
05:07:58,480 --> 05:08:02,240
and kill it even if it end up with him

7886
05:08:00,320 --> 05:08:03,280
dying. Two das now for Bro. They're

7887
05:08:02,240 --> 05:08:06,480
going to be feeling amazing about that

7888
05:08:03,280 --> 05:08:08,160
as well. Yeah, some uh individual

7889
05:08:06,480 --> 05:08:09,280
mountain das also feel pretty good with

7890
05:08:08,160 --> 05:08:12,000
this composition that doesn't really

7891
05:08:09,280 --> 05:08:14,080
have a true tank as all right in goes

7892
05:08:12,000 --> 05:08:15,760
the V. Doesn't quite find the V breaker

7893
05:08:14,080 --> 05:08:17,200
and will just get that back massage and

7894
05:08:15,760 --> 05:08:19,680
put into the death chamber with the

7895
05:08:17,200 --> 05:08:21,120
equalizer. Very well played here by DRX

7896
05:08:19,680 --> 05:08:22,878
to lock down the jungler, but just a

7897
05:08:21,120 --> 05:08:25,280
little bit of a step too far there by by

7898
05:08:22,878 --> 05:08:27,760
Crocco on the bottom side of the map. So

7899
05:08:25,280 --> 05:08:30,240
they'll lose the turret and DRX

7900
05:08:27,760 --> 05:08:32,958
incremental little step back into this

7901
05:08:30,240 --> 05:08:35,600
game. Unforced arrow there by Krokco.

7902
05:08:32,958 --> 05:08:37,600
Gets the drake. That was big. Uh if he'd

7903
05:08:35,600 --> 05:08:38,958
given his life, taken the drake, I think

7904
05:08:37,600 --> 05:08:42,160
it wouldn't have felt as bad, but that

7905
05:08:38,958 --> 05:08:44,958
was just not necessary. Just walks up,

7906
05:08:42,160 --> 05:08:47,040
tries to go for the Q, and just uh dies

7907
05:08:44,958 --> 05:08:48,160
unceremoniously. Very straightforward.

7908
05:08:47,040 --> 05:08:50,958
Doesn't have flash, so you can't use

7909
05:08:48,160 --> 05:08:52,320
your Q like that. Even if he hits it, I

7910
05:08:50,958 --> 05:08:55,280
don't really think you can do too much

7911
05:08:52,320 --> 05:08:57,280
with it. Two item spikes now being hit

7912
05:08:55,280 --> 05:09:00,560
across the board. There's the stopwatch

7913
05:08:57,280 --> 05:09:02,638
for Rich. Sterox for Morgan. Man, this

7914
05:09:00,560 --> 05:09:04,240
really is closer versus Teddy, isn't it?

7915
05:09:02,638 --> 05:09:06,718
503

7916
05:09:04,240 --> 05:09:08,320
on this Lucian.

7917
05:09:06,718 --> 05:09:09,120
He's been doing a good amount of gaming.

7918
05:09:08,320 --> 05:09:10,080
He's back.

7919
05:09:09,120 --> 05:09:12,320
Yeah.

7920
05:09:10,080 --> 05:09:14,160
Oh, wow. That's a good time to start

7921
05:09:12,320 --> 05:09:15,280
talking about him as well. That's a big

7922
05:09:14,160 --> 05:09:17,120
spike.

7923
05:09:15,280 --> 05:09:18,718
He is still Lucian though. So, if he

7924
05:09:17,120 --> 05:09:20,480
does get over by Crocco and Closer gets

7925
05:09:18,718 --> 05:09:20,878
on top of him, I do think he dies

7926
05:09:20,480 --> 05:09:22,638
indeed.

7927
05:09:20,878 --> 05:09:24,638
And DRX, their job is to make sure that

7928
05:09:22,638 --> 05:09:27,360
that exact cuz everyone else I think you

7929
05:09:24,638 --> 05:09:28,560
can do without like Yo, Rich, it's fine.

7930
05:09:27,360 --> 05:09:31,120
You don't actually need them to win a

7931
05:09:28,560 --> 05:09:32,480
fight. You do need Teddy. Teddy needs to

7932
05:09:31,120 --> 05:09:33,920
live.

7933
05:09:32,480 --> 05:09:36,080
And there's no males or anything like

7934
05:09:33,920 --> 05:09:39,040
that. So over charm hits onto Teddy. He

7935
05:09:36,080 --> 05:09:40,798
is dead. That's likely what the layering

7936
05:09:39,040 --> 05:09:42,080
of CC is going to be. Crocco goes in,

7937
05:09:40,798 --> 05:09:44,480
hits him with the cease and assist, and

7938
05:09:42,080 --> 05:09:46,080
then you just pour everything on top.

7939
05:09:44,480 --> 05:09:47,600
The vision denial is the main thing

7940
05:09:46,080 --> 05:09:48,718
because if you have multiple angles from

7941
05:09:47,600 --> 05:09:51,040
which you can come, then you can

7942
05:09:48,718 --> 05:09:53,360
actually take down Teddy. But if he

7943
05:09:51,040 --> 05:09:56,638
knows you're there, then you're going to

7944
05:09:53,360 --> 05:09:58,400
have a much tougher time. So denying as

7945
05:09:56,638 --> 05:10:01,840
many wards as possible is a big deal for

7946
05:09:58,400 --> 05:10:03,920
Bro here. So DRX doing the opposite

7947
05:10:01,840 --> 05:10:06,560
trying to make sure that Uniel can just

7948
05:10:03,920 --> 05:10:08,400
create as much vision as possible. Yeah,

7949
05:10:06,560 --> 05:10:10,080
about 1,000 gold here for Morgan top

7950
05:10:08,400 --> 05:10:12,080
side of the map. Two items to two and a

7951
05:10:10,080 --> 05:10:13,920
bit here from Rich. Pretty happy to have

7952
05:10:12,080 --> 05:10:15,600
the Oblivion orb as well. Trisha Barrage

7953
05:10:13,920 --> 05:10:18,240
going to pick the gap and in fact there

7954
05:10:15,600 --> 05:10:22,638
were four post. So that was AFL 100% six

7955
05:10:18,240 --> 05:10:24,400
points. Closer pushes this wave in.

7956
05:10:22,638 --> 05:10:26,560
deals with that at least one level lead

7957
05:10:24,400 --> 05:10:28,958
here for Morgan. Items aren't

7958
05:10:26,560 --> 05:10:30,080
necessarily looking to Atrox favor in

7959
05:10:28,958 --> 05:10:31,200
this match up right now. And I think

7960
05:10:30,080 --> 05:10:33,040
Rich is going to be kind of okay with

7961
05:10:31,200 --> 05:10:35,680
just picking up this wave as it heads

7962
05:10:33,040 --> 05:10:37,920
towards the turret.

7963
05:10:35,680 --> 05:10:39,760
But yeah, Teddy against the world. It's

7964
05:10:37,920 --> 05:10:44,080
just Jin Air all over again. Why is it

7965
05:10:39,760 --> 05:10:46,400
always just it all comes back to Jinire?

7966
05:10:44,080 --> 05:10:49,280
Good question. I don't know. Kind of

7967
05:10:46,400 --> 05:10:50,878
crazy.

7968
05:10:49,280 --> 05:10:53,680
He is also an AD carry. do think that

7969
05:10:50,878 --> 05:10:55,360
they have this situation happen a lot

7970
05:10:53,680 --> 05:10:56,878
and then they make one misstep that

7971
05:10:55,360 --> 05:10:59,840
arguably isn't a misstep and they just

7972
05:10:56,878 --> 05:11:01,520
die and it's well game's done.

7973
05:10:59,840 --> 05:11:04,878
Oh, Crocker clearing out some vision

7974
05:11:01,520 --> 05:11:07,040
here. It's DRX. Oh, once closer gets

7975
05:11:04,878 --> 05:11:07,680
that death gap. That is a big spike.

7976
05:11:07,040 --> 05:11:09,280
Oh god.

7977
05:11:07,680 --> 05:11:11,760
I think DRX might want to look for a

7978
05:11:09,280 --> 05:11:13,760
fight right now to try and deny that. He

7979
05:11:11,760 --> 05:11:15,520
has the 10 stacks already completed as

7980
05:11:13,760 --> 05:11:17,040
well. Oh, that's going to be a ton of AP

7981
05:11:15,520 --> 05:11:18,798
Atlas.

7982
05:11:17,040 --> 05:11:19,920
Yeah, hype possibly in trouble, but the

7983
05:11:18,798 --> 05:11:21,280
pillar are not really doing too much.

7984
05:11:19,920 --> 05:11:23,840
Trish shot barrage just to spin the wave

7985
05:11:21,280 --> 05:11:26,080
as best they can. That's an arcane shift

7986
05:11:23,840 --> 05:11:29,440
as in comes closer. He's spotted on

7987
05:11:26,080 --> 05:11:32,958
vision, but what? And is just dead. He's

7988
05:11:29,440 --> 05:11:34,560
just too far up. Just a mistake here

7989
05:11:32,958 --> 05:11:36,480
from the support out of DRX. And you

7990
05:11:34,560 --> 05:11:39,600
said it already. He's the only one that

7991
05:11:36,480 --> 05:11:42,160
can hold people in position.

7992
05:11:39,600 --> 05:11:45,120
Well, Baron Pit might be doing them some

7993
05:11:42,160 --> 05:11:47,760
favors here. That's a close and tight

7994
05:11:45,120 --> 05:11:50,240
corridor. Oh, look at the setup here.

7995
05:11:47,760 --> 05:11:52,718
Multi and Crocco looking

7996
05:11:50,240 --> 05:11:54,400
on the angle. Finds their way in. There

7997
05:11:52,718 --> 05:11:57,040
is the flash forward from Closer, but

7998
05:11:54,400 --> 05:11:58,798
Teddy's life and then he's taken out.

7999
05:11:57,040 --> 05:12:00,320
Rich also is going to be able to go

8000
05:11:58,798 --> 05:12:02,560
golden, but that's a sea or death type

8001
05:12:00,320 --> 05:12:04,160
goal. And now, Yahoo finds himself

8002
05:12:02,560 --> 05:12:07,760
running the wrong direction. They save

8003
05:12:04,160 --> 05:12:09,440
the the Azir till last and Sponge is

8004
05:12:07,760 --> 05:12:10,958
running for the hills. This is a Baron

8005
05:12:09,440 --> 05:12:13,600
if the Bros want it, but they might look

8006
05:12:10,958 --> 05:12:16,878
to break open the base first as the true

8007
05:12:13,600 --> 05:12:19,760
barrage sails by. Oh man, probably going

8008
05:12:16,878 --> 05:12:21,440
to be kicking himself after that one.

8009
05:12:19,760 --> 05:12:24,080
Wonder what happened there. It's I think

8010
05:12:21,440 --> 05:12:25,120
another example of DRX not all being on

8011
05:12:24,080 --> 05:12:25,600
the same page.

8012
05:12:25,120 --> 05:12:27,440
Yeah,

8013
05:12:25,600 --> 05:12:29,280
cuz

8014
05:12:27,440 --> 05:12:31,280
he needs to step up to try and secure

8015
05:12:29,280 --> 05:12:32,878
vision. But I hope we get a replay to

8016
05:12:31,280 --> 05:12:34,480
see what actually happened there. Felt

8017
05:12:32,878 --> 05:12:37,120
like

8018
05:12:34,480 --> 05:12:39,120
he both overstepped. But if the rest of

8019
05:12:37,120 --> 05:12:40,718
the team at least provides some safety,

8020
05:12:39,120 --> 05:12:43,280
maybe that could have been something. We

8021
05:12:40,718 --> 05:12:44,560
did see though the problem for Teddy as

8022
05:12:43,280 --> 05:12:45,120
Okay, guys. This game is

8023
05:12:44,560 --> 05:12:45,840
It's um

8024
05:12:45,120 --> 05:12:47,360
This game is done.

8025
05:12:45,840 --> 05:12:49,520
It's not looking too good. That's a nice

8026
05:12:47,360 --> 05:12:51,120
solo flare, though. Polo comes on over

8027
05:12:49,520 --> 05:12:52,560
just to see what's going on.

8028
05:12:51,120 --> 05:12:55,760
Yeah, but the game is done.

8029
05:12:52,560 --> 05:12:59,920
It is. And it's so weird that it's an

8030
05:12:55,760 --> 05:13:02,240
exact mirror of what we saw in game one.

8031
05:12:59,920 --> 05:13:05,120
But the other side. Um okay, we're

8032
05:13:02,240 --> 05:13:06,958
rushing a Baron as Soul Point is looking

8033
05:13:05,120 --> 05:13:08,080
to be picked up here by the Bros.

8034
05:13:06,958 --> 05:13:08,400
YOLO.

8035
05:13:08,080 --> 05:13:11,120
Yeah.

8036
05:13:08,400 --> 05:13:13,360
Oh. Oh,

8037
05:13:11,120 --> 05:13:14,638
but hang on. They do a lot of damage to

8038
05:13:13,360 --> 05:13:17,600
Baron.

8039
05:13:14,638 --> 05:13:18,958
They might be able to take this.

8040
05:13:17,600 --> 05:13:20,560
Have that teleport to come in from

8041
05:13:18,958 --> 05:13:23,040
Morgan.

8042
05:13:20,560 --> 05:13:24,320
Angle true barrage to lay on through. It

8043
05:13:23,040 --> 05:13:26,878
is going to be rich that locks down the

8044
05:13:24,320 --> 05:13:28,000
baron for TRX. Teddy has been dove on

8045
05:13:26,878 --> 05:13:30,080
though. He does manage to take down

8046
05:13:28,000 --> 05:13:31,760
Crocco, but Morgan's there to end his

8047
05:13:30,080 --> 05:13:33,440
world. Yahoo now trying to get out of

8048
05:13:31,760 --> 05:13:35,040
the way. And the Emperor's Divide

8049
05:13:33,440 --> 05:13:36,638
doesn't really do anything.

8050
05:13:35,040 --> 05:13:38,000
Unfortunately, if you divide by zero,

8051
05:13:36,638 --> 05:13:40,638
you're just going to find yourself in

8052
05:13:38,000 --> 05:13:43,760
the death chamber. And there is the win

8053
05:13:40,638 --> 05:13:45,040
for the although I guess croc died and

8054
05:13:43,760 --> 05:13:48,160
closer lost a whole bunch of

8055
05:13:45,040 --> 05:13:50,160
stats. Wait wait wait wait wait.

8056
05:13:48,160 --> 05:13:52,560
This is a huge trade up. They got soul

8057
05:13:50,160 --> 05:13:53,600
point and Nash. Okay. Yeah. And it

8058
05:13:52,560 --> 05:13:55,040
looked like we were just looking at the

8059
05:13:53,600 --> 05:13:58,878
bit of the fight the bro won and I'm

8060
05:13:55,040 --> 05:14:00,560
like oh it's all great but it's not.

8061
05:13:58,878 --> 05:14:03,680
Okay.

8062
05:14:00,560 --> 05:14:05,840
The DRX macro.

8063
05:14:03,680 --> 05:14:07,440
Yeah. I don't know how that even works

8064
05:14:05,840 --> 05:14:09,520
but let's have a look at it again. So,

8065
05:14:07,440 --> 05:14:11,840
this was just a straight flip.

8066
05:14:09,520 --> 05:14:12,798
Pure 50/50. That might end up deciding

8067
05:14:11,840 --> 05:14:15,840
the game.

8068
05:14:12,798 --> 05:14:18,480
Uh, goes down to 150, by the way.

8069
05:14:15,840 --> 05:14:20,160
Um, not sure how that happened. And then

8070
05:14:18,480 --> 05:14:21,920
Teddy does take down Krock, but more

8071
05:14:20,160 --> 05:14:24,560
importantly,

8072
05:14:21,920 --> 05:14:25,840
close or dice. Was Hype just not there?

8073
05:14:24,560 --> 05:14:27,920
No, he he based.

8074
05:14:25,840 --> 05:14:28,400
Uh-huh. And he he had to cuz he had no

8075
05:14:27,920 --> 05:14:30,320
health.

8076
05:14:28,400 --> 05:14:34,400
Yeah. Uh, but that did mean that they

8077
05:14:30,320 --> 05:14:37,520
they were down a member. H Yeah,

8078
05:14:34,400 --> 05:14:39,440
quizzical. Yes, it was certainly a turn

8079
05:14:37,520 --> 05:14:40,958
of events. It's also an even bigger

8080
05:14:39,440 --> 05:14:44,560
deal, right? Because that's eight stacks

8081
05:14:40,958 --> 05:14:48,000
off the forbidden book for closer and so

8082
05:14:44,560 --> 05:14:49,760
it's going to have to find another

8083
05:14:48,000 --> 05:14:52,480
me back to the red. I want to see that

8084
05:14:49,760 --> 05:14:54,080
gold craft go up and down.

8085
05:14:52,480 --> 05:14:56,958
It's not quite a heart monitor unless

8086
05:14:54,080 --> 05:14:58,718
you have a very very slow amount of BPM.

8087
05:14:56,958 --> 05:15:02,280
But we are getting back towards a beat

8088
05:14:58,718 --> 05:15:02,280
on the other side.

8089
05:15:02,878 --> 05:15:06,798
Their siege is good. they can set up.

8090
05:15:05,440 --> 05:15:08,480
Need to actually get to the turret

8091
05:15:06,798 --> 05:15:11,760
though.

8092
05:15:08,480 --> 05:15:14,160
And a team fight when it works

8093
05:15:11,760 --> 05:15:15,360
looks pretty good for DRX as well as

8094
05:15:14,160 --> 05:15:18,000
let's see whether some more of these

8095
05:15:15,360 --> 05:15:20,080
picks can actually Oh my god. Dear Rich

8096
05:15:18,000 --> 05:15:21,920
taking so much damage. Closer having to

8097
05:15:20,080 --> 05:15:24,240
use the odd just to avoid the culling.

8098
05:15:21,920 --> 05:15:25,920
But once again, Andal is in no man's

8099
05:15:24,240 --> 05:15:27,120
land. Emperor's Divide just to buy some

8100
05:15:25,920 --> 05:15:29,280
space. And it might have actually done

8101
05:15:27,120 --> 05:15:31,040
so as Teddy down so low. Still trying to

8102
05:15:29,280 --> 05:15:33,600
kite. Still trying to do damage as

8103
05:15:31,040 --> 05:15:35,520
Crocco. He can't get there. Oh my god,

8104
05:15:33,600 --> 05:15:38,400
Teddy, you monster. But he's left the

8105
05:15:35,520 --> 05:15:40,718
rest of his team. And they are going to

8106
05:15:38,400 --> 05:15:43,200
fall down. Rich with the teleport in and

8107
05:15:40,718 --> 05:15:45,200
then the run away. And wait, was this

8108
05:15:43,200 --> 05:15:45,520
another DX straight up? I don't really

8109
05:15:45,200 --> 05:15:48,160
know

8110
05:15:45,520 --> 05:15:50,400
where the rich did he base.

8111
05:15:48,160 --> 05:15:51,600
I thought he was dead before. What

8112
05:15:50,400 --> 05:15:52,400
happened? What?

8113
05:15:51,600 --> 05:15:54,320
I don't know.

8114
05:15:52,400 --> 05:15:56,638
Show Atlas. This game's This game is

8115
05:15:54,320 --> 05:15:59,360
getting to me. What is happening? Why

8116
05:15:56,638 --> 05:16:01,040
Why are these events transpiring? I'm

8117
05:15:59,360 --> 05:16:02,878
I'm watching it and trying to yell about

8118
05:16:01,040 --> 05:16:05,280
it when it's happening and I still have

8119
05:16:02,878 --> 05:16:08,160
no idea. I have to admit to you.

8120
05:16:05,280 --> 05:16:11,600
I think we need another replay. Okay, so

8121
05:16:08,160 --> 05:16:13,520
the poke is really good here from Bro

8122
05:16:11,600 --> 05:16:15,360
and Poke actually finding the angle on

8123
05:16:13,520 --> 05:16:18,798
Rich was really good. So Rich runs away.

8124
05:16:15,360 --> 05:16:20,480
So Rich runs away and then I I legit

8125
05:16:18,798 --> 05:16:22,878
think if he just goes in here and toast

8126
05:16:20,480 --> 05:16:24,958
them, I think they just all die. But he

8127
05:16:22,878 --> 05:16:26,638
has empower So the he has empowered

8128
05:16:24,958 --> 05:16:28,400
Baron recall so he thinks he can get out

8129
05:16:26,638 --> 05:16:29,920
and then get back in. Yeah,

8130
05:16:28,400 --> 05:16:31,360
but then he doesn't. And if Teddy dies

8131
05:16:29,920 --> 05:16:33,440
there, that's game. I'm not even jo

8132
05:16:31,360 --> 05:16:35,760
That's That's game over right there.

8133
05:16:33,440 --> 05:16:37,440
But it's not. He doesn't die.

8134
05:16:35,760 --> 05:16:38,080
So, we get another fight. This game is

8135
05:16:37,440 --> 05:16:39,920
still not done.

8136
05:16:38,080 --> 05:16:42,480
And Closer just won a team fight, but

8137
05:16:39,920 --> 05:16:44,000
he'd already sold his book.

8138
05:16:42,480 --> 05:16:45,120
A

8139
05:16:44,000 --> 05:16:46,000
feels terrible, doesn't it?

8140
05:16:45,120 --> 05:16:47,920
That's bad.

8141
05:16:46,000 --> 05:16:48,958
Wait, guys. There's no objective.

8142
05:16:47,920 --> 05:16:50,080
Why are we in river?

8143
05:16:48,958 --> 05:16:51,200
You got to fight for the river.

8144
05:16:50,080 --> 05:16:52,080
No. Push the side lanes.

8145
05:16:51,200 --> 05:16:54,240
No, no, no, no.

8146
05:16:52,080 --> 05:16:58,400
So, Yahoo, despite being two and seven,

8147
05:16:54,240 --> 05:16:59,760
is about to finish his death camp.

8148
05:16:58,400 --> 05:17:02,638
This is a game, Atlas.

8149
05:16:59,760 --> 05:17:03,920
Oh, it really is. This is This is one of

8150
05:17:02,638 --> 05:17:05,200
the most games that I've

8151
05:17:03,920 --> 05:17:05,840
Do you know what this is?

8152
05:17:05,200 --> 05:17:07,360
What is this?

8153
05:17:05,840 --> 05:17:09,520
This is Rise, baby.

8154
05:17:07,360 --> 05:17:11,200
Oh, heck yeah.

8155
05:17:09,520 --> 05:17:13,680
Wasn't it cool? Yesterday we got two

8156
05:17:11,200 --> 05:17:15,440
Rise Rise series, one after the other.

8157
05:17:13,680 --> 05:17:15,760
That was amazing. We It was a real

8158
05:17:15,440 --> 05:17:18,080
treat.

8159
05:17:15,760 --> 05:17:19,760
I thought you were You were You were

8160
05:17:18,080 --> 05:17:23,040
hyping up KT.

8161
05:17:19,760 --> 05:17:25,520
I think Rise is the better group.

8162
05:17:23,040 --> 05:17:28,320
GenT1, that's nothing. Yeah, it's not

8163
05:17:25,520 --> 05:17:30,080
compared to this.

8164
05:17:28,320 --> 05:17:32,080
I don't even understand this. It's so

8165
05:17:30,080 --> 05:17:33,280
far ahead of me that I just don't even

8166
05:17:32,080 --> 05:17:35,520
get it. I'm

8167
05:17:33,280 --> 05:17:37,680
so glad we're back at the LCK and we get

8168
05:17:35,520 --> 05:17:38,000
to witness this League of Legends.

8169
05:17:37,680 --> 05:17:40,320
Exactly.

8170
05:17:38,000 --> 05:17:42,400
That's Challengers, baby. Why wasn't Bro

8171
05:17:40,320 --> 05:17:45,680
at MSI? Ah, because they'd make everyone

8172
05:17:42,400 --> 05:17:48,400
else look too silly. That's why they're

8173
05:17:45,680 --> 05:17:50,000
not ready for Bro on the international

8174
05:17:48,400 --> 05:17:52,320
stage.

8175
05:17:50,000 --> 05:17:54,798
Maybe one day. Well, they they you know,

8176
05:17:52,320 --> 05:17:56,480
theoretically it's possible. Oh, he's

8177
05:17:54,798 --> 05:17:58,240
going to show him the door. Pretty good

8178
05:17:56,480 --> 05:17:59,680
about that.

8179
05:17:58,240 --> 05:18:01,120
Morgan, Morgan, Morgan, Morgan.

8180
05:17:59,680 --> 05:18:03,440
It's the Pinser attack. There's the

8181
05:18:01,120 --> 05:18:04,878
flash in right on top of Yahoo. But it's

8182
05:18:03,440 --> 05:18:06,480
it's the Lucian they have to take down

8183
05:18:04,878 --> 05:18:08,160
and they absolutely do that. The Empress

8184
05:18:06,480 --> 05:18:09,920
Divide on to three, but what is that

8185
05:18:08,160 --> 05:18:12,560
going to do? The answer is nothing at

8186
05:18:09,920 --> 05:18:15,600
all as Hype hits two with the ulti on

8187
05:18:12,560 --> 05:18:18,240
the back end. Sponge gets eliminated. Is

8188
05:18:15,600 --> 05:18:20,560
that a clean ace? Is that a clean ace

8189
05:18:18,240 --> 05:18:22,798
for the pros? It absolutely is. This is

8190
05:18:20,560 --> 05:18:26,400
Anvil for the first time this series

8191
05:18:22,798 --> 05:18:29,040
goes down last and the Bros will move on

8192
05:18:26,400 --> 05:18:34,160
to game three.

8193
05:18:29,040 --> 05:18:37,440
Not even close, baby. As Lord Morgan

8194
05:18:34,160 --> 05:18:40,000
with the taxes in his hand, heavy with

8195
05:18:37,440 --> 05:18:42,000
gold finds the flank. Crocco gets on top

8196
05:18:40,000 --> 05:18:44,240
of Teddy. Teddy did not get to play the

8197
05:18:42,000 --> 05:18:46,638
game by the way as we highlighted that

8198
05:18:44,240 --> 05:18:47,840
Vari combo ends up being the difference

8199
05:18:46,638 --> 05:18:52,000
maker.

8200
05:18:47,840 --> 05:18:54,718
That was ridiculous. The Lord has never

8201
05:18:52,000 --> 05:18:57,040
had a performance like this on Aatrox in

8202
05:18:54,718 --> 05:18:59,120
my recent memory. I I just honestly

8203
05:18:57,040 --> 05:19:01,840
haven't seen it. This is often times a

8204
05:18:59,120 --> 05:19:04,320
pick that he's not quite found success

8205
05:19:01,840 --> 05:19:07,920
on, especially for closing out games.

8206
05:19:04,320 --> 05:19:12,160
That flank angle absolutely beautiful.

8207
05:19:07,920 --> 05:19:14,160
And DRX just crumbled.

8208
05:19:12,160 --> 05:19:16,320
Oh my goodness.

8209
05:19:14,160 --> 05:19:17,920
We are learning. We are learning many

8210
05:19:16,320 --> 05:19:20,240
things. We are learning that early leads

8211
05:19:17,920 --> 05:19:21,840
are bait. We are learning that Azir is

8212
05:19:20,240 --> 05:19:23,680
overrated

8213
05:19:21,840 --> 05:19:24,958
and maybe we are learning that Broax

8214
05:19:23,680 --> 05:19:27,040
does in fact matter.

8215
05:19:24,958 --> 05:19:29,120
Broax does matter and I

8216
05:19:27,040 --> 05:19:30,638
Okay, I need I need evidence but we're

8217
05:19:29,120 --> 05:19:31,440
we're getting evidence. We're gathering

8218
05:19:30,638 --> 05:19:32,958
it right now.

8219
05:19:31,440 --> 05:19:36,480
This is the thing. What you did is you

8220
05:19:32,958 --> 05:19:40,560
just pitted the power of Broax against

8221
05:19:36,480 --> 05:19:43,120
Azir and it just shows Broax is more

8222
05:19:40,560 --> 05:19:46,000
powerful than how good this champion is.

8223
05:19:43,120 --> 05:19:48,718
I think it was just Azir or sorry uh

8224
05:19:46,000 --> 05:19:50,240
Vari just dunking on the only Honestly,

8225
05:19:48,718 --> 05:19:51,680
it was a bit of a reminder because we

8226
05:19:50,240 --> 05:19:53,680
did see like

8227
05:19:51,680 --> 05:19:54,798
there's been many examples of V looking

8228
05:19:53,680 --> 05:19:56,718
a bit muted,

8229
05:19:54,798 --> 05:19:59,760
but then sometimes she can just

8230
05:19:56,718 --> 05:20:01,600
she can just press R on someone and that

8231
05:19:59,760 --> 05:20:03,760
someone is really important and when

8232
05:20:01,600 --> 05:20:05,200
they're dead, there's no way to win the

8233
05:20:03,760 --> 05:20:07,600
team fight.

8234
05:20:05,200 --> 05:20:08,958
Oh golly gee, we get another one of

8235
05:20:07,600 --> 05:20:11,440
these chronicler. Time for us to take a

8236
05:20:08,958 --> 05:20:13,040
shot. The space going to break it down

8237
05:20:11,440 --> 05:20:15,680
and we'll be back for game number three.

8238
05:20:13,040 --> 05:20:17,680

Hello and welcome back to the space.

8277
05:26:51,840 --> 05:26:55,840
We're here after game number two where

8278
05:26:53,440 --> 05:26:58,080
Bro was finally able to take it down. It

8279
05:26:55,840 --> 05:26:59,840
was a very close affair being very back

8280
05:26:58,080 --> 05:27:02,160
and forth towards the end with some of

8281
05:26:59,840 --> 05:27:04,080
the Azir and Lucian damage from the side

8282
05:27:02,160 --> 05:27:06,958
of DRX. Wasn't enough to get them across

8283
05:27:04,080 --> 05:27:09,040
the line. Bro do tie it up and now we go

8284
05:27:06,958 --> 05:27:11,840
all the way. Gentlemen, what happened in

8285
05:27:09,040 --> 05:27:13,680
that game number two? I thought Bro had

8286
05:27:11,840 --> 05:27:15,520
once again a draft where they can

8287
05:27:13,680 --> 05:27:17,040
control the early game. They'll have to

8288
05:27:15,520 --> 05:27:18,638
make some tough decisions in the mid to

8289
05:27:17,040 --> 05:27:20,560
late and they should be able to pull it

8290
05:27:18,638 --> 05:27:22,718
off, right? They get ahead early, right?

8291
05:27:20,560 --> 05:27:24,320
They did not get ahead early. Uh in

8292
05:27:22,718 --> 05:27:25,760
fact, it was a little bit problematic.

8293
05:27:24,320 --> 05:27:28,320
We were scared that the Azir was going

8294
05:27:25,760 --> 05:27:29,920
to get out of control. The very big hole

8295
05:27:28,320 --> 05:27:31,760
in the bottom lane with illusion was a

8296
05:27:29,920 --> 05:27:34,080
bit of a problem, but eventually the

8297
05:27:31,760 --> 05:27:37,120
comp, yes, was quite simple to execute

8298
05:27:34,080 --> 05:27:40,160
and bro buttons. Yeah, I was kind of

8299
05:27:37,120 --> 05:27:42,320
confused that uh Vi and Ari didn't make

8300
05:27:40,160 --> 05:27:44,638
the play by themselves in the early game

8301
05:27:42,320 --> 05:27:46,240
because they're known as early game

8302
05:27:44,638 --> 05:27:48,638
king. They could actually make some

8303
05:27:46,240 --> 05:27:51,040
plays on the side lane and help your

8304
05:27:48,638 --> 05:27:53,440
laners to win the pressure. But I feel

8305
05:27:51,040 --> 05:27:55,440
like it was kind of late at the moment.

8306
05:27:53,440 --> 05:27:57,600
But in the in the we going to see the

8307
05:27:55,440 --> 05:28:01,280
first highlight, but it was actually

8308
05:27:57,600 --> 05:28:04,080
huge enough to bounce back because uh DX

8309
05:28:01,280 --> 05:28:05,920
was kind of trusting themselves too much

8310
05:28:04,080 --> 05:28:08,240
in the early game. Uh and their team

8311
05:28:05,920 --> 05:28:08,958
comp was not about that one against Ari

8312
05:28:08,240 --> 05:28:10,000
and Vi.

8313
05:28:08,958 --> 05:28:13,680
Yeah, we should definitely talk about

8314
05:28:10,000 --> 05:28:15,680
the draft and uh just see what was going

8315
05:28:13,680 --> 05:28:17,440
on in this one because the VI was picked

8316
05:28:15,680 --> 05:28:20,480
first and then the re followup from

8317
05:28:17,440 --> 05:28:22,160
closer. It just feels like traditional

8318
05:28:20,480 --> 05:28:24,958
crocco closer duo, right?

8319
05:28:22,160 --> 05:28:26,878
The main issue I had for DRX before they

8320
05:28:24,958 --> 05:28:28,480
got to the last phase of the picks,

8321
05:28:26,878 --> 05:28:29,920
right, was their lack of engage. Like

8322
05:28:28,480 --> 05:28:33,120
they sure they have his ear and they

8323
05:28:29,920 --> 05:28:35,200
have pillar, but Ezreal gets locked in

8324
05:28:33,120 --> 05:28:36,638
first. They take the Lucian instead for

8325
05:28:35,200 --> 05:28:38,638
some reason instead of taking the Ezreal

8326
05:28:36,638 --> 05:28:40,558
themselves. Then they pick Leona cuz

8327
05:28:38,638 --> 05:28:42,958
like well we really need some type of

8328
05:28:40,558 --> 05:28:44,798
engage. But into this draft, if you're

8329
05:28:42,958 --> 05:28:47,920
not super coordinated or if you fall

8330
05:28:44,798 --> 05:28:50,240
behind, the Leona dies slowly but dies

8331
05:28:47,920 --> 05:28:52,080
repeatedly as we unfortunately did see

8332
05:28:50,240 --> 05:28:54,480
for Andil in this game. I mean, it keeps

8333
05:28:52,080 --> 05:28:56,878
happening whenever junglers are playing

8334
05:28:54,480 --> 05:28:59,680
Trundle. They know they're stronger, but

8335
05:28:56,878 --> 05:29:02,400
it's really hard to target someone in

8336
05:28:59,680 --> 05:29:04,638
the fight. So, uh I think teams are

8337
05:29:02,400 --> 05:29:07,360
starting to confuse more whenever they

8338
05:29:04,638 --> 05:29:09,680
are playing Trundle. And they uh bro,

8339
05:29:07,360 --> 05:29:12,638
they really have the easy comp. they can

8340
05:29:09,680 --> 05:29:14,638
just target one one champion and just uh

8341
05:29:12,638 --> 05:29:16,480
just dive into it. And I think that's

8342
05:29:14,638 --> 05:29:18,080
what happened in this game mainly.

8343
05:29:16,480 --> 05:29:19,360
Yeah, definitely did. We should talk a

8344
05:29:18,080 --> 05:29:21,520
little bit about the game. We had a

8345
05:29:19,360 --> 05:29:23,360
highlight here for the side of Bro 15

8346
05:29:21,520 --> 05:29:25,280
minutes in this was this was the first

8347
05:29:23,360 --> 05:29:27,040
fight where it felt like okay, they're

8348
05:29:25,280 --> 05:29:28,240
playing to their composition. They have

8349
05:29:27,040 --> 05:29:29,440
Vi. They're going to press their

8350
05:29:28,240 --> 05:29:30,958
buttons. They did it well.

8351
05:29:29,440 --> 05:29:32,320
I have serious issues with how DRX

8352
05:29:30,958 --> 05:29:34,320
approached this fight. So super

8353
05:29:32,320 --> 05:29:36,958
halfhazard here from Teddy. There's no

8354
05:29:34,320 --> 05:29:39,120
setup. like ult Palo and this flanking

8355
05:29:36,958 --> 05:29:41,680
Azir where Bro already knew he was

8356
05:29:39,120 --> 05:29:44,240
topside is such an easy target to

8357
05:29:41,680 --> 05:29:45,760
collapse on and they just turn away from

8358
05:29:44,240 --> 05:29:47,680
the enemy Lucian and go well that's an

8359
05:29:45,760 --> 05:29:48,878
Azir that's the only way we lose this

8360
05:29:47,680 --> 05:29:52,480
fight he doesn't get to Emperor's Divide

8361
05:29:48,878 --> 05:29:54,160
he's CCed and taken down DRX threw the

8362
05:29:52,480 --> 05:29:56,558
game here basically in terms of the lead

8363
05:29:54,160 --> 05:29:58,080
they had by just trying to force a fight

8364
05:29:56,558 --> 05:29:59,920
where they had no right to do if the

8365
05:29:58,080 --> 05:30:01,680
Azir is with the rest of the team on the

8366
05:29:59,920 --> 05:30:03,600
other side they could use the Azir to

8367
05:30:01,680 --> 05:30:05,440
peel and look for some additional damage

8368
05:30:03,600 --> 05:30:06,480
or if They collapse towards illusion a

8369
05:30:05,440 --> 05:30:08,240
little bit fast or sorry towards the

8370
05:30:06,480 --> 05:30:09,760
Azir a little bit faster. Maybe they can

8371
05:30:08,240 --> 05:30:11,360
make that happen. But it's such an easy

8372
05:30:09,760 --> 05:30:13,600
call. The second they see the Azir

8373
05:30:11,360 --> 05:30:15,360
physically like with their eyes to just

8374
05:30:13,600 --> 05:30:16,240
use their first V ultimate of the game

8375
05:30:15,360 --> 05:30:17,600
and take him out.

8376
05:30:16,240 --> 05:30:19,520
Yeah, as you mentioned, the right

8377
05:30:17,600 --> 05:30:21,440
approach with the Trundle jungle is just

8378
05:30:19,520 --> 05:30:23,840
hit the front line with your Trundle and

8379
05:30:21,440 --> 05:30:26,718
you have your DPS on your back, but Azer

8380
05:30:23,840 --> 05:30:29,120
was on the front in front of a Ari and

8381
05:30:26,718 --> 05:30:31,120
Vi, which makes no sense here.

8382
05:30:29,120 --> 05:30:32,638
Certainly didn't uh did put him in the

8383
05:30:31,120 --> 05:30:35,120
death chamber. Now we're going to jump

8384
05:30:32,638 --> 05:30:37,760
very far into the future about 19

8385
05:30:35,120 --> 05:30:39,440
minutes later 34 minutes into this game.

8386
05:30:37,760 --> 05:30:41,440
The last fight that Bro were able to

8387
05:30:39,440 --> 05:30:44,558
take down and end this game on.

8388
05:30:41,440 --> 05:30:46,240
I mean Bro this time around they didn't

8389
05:30:44,558 --> 05:30:48,080
throw in the objective. They just gave

8390
05:30:46,240 --> 05:30:49,600
up the objective but they kept the

8391
05:30:48,080 --> 05:30:52,558
pressure and that's why they were ahead

8392
05:30:49,600 --> 05:30:55,280
in uh many moment and here it was great

8393
05:30:52,558 --> 05:30:57,360
TP flank from Morgan and at this point

8394
05:30:55,280 --> 05:30:59,760
they were just super ahead in the game.

8395
05:30:57,360 --> 05:31:02,878
So all they need to do is jump into the

8396
05:30:59,760 --> 05:31:04,718
target and demolish them. I mean Yahoo

8397
05:31:02,878 --> 05:31:06,400
played it as best as he could. I I think

8398
05:31:04,718 --> 05:31:08,320
really I mean he was able to zone and

8399
05:31:06,400 --> 05:31:10,320
then get away and set up for a big peel

8400
05:31:08,320 --> 05:31:13,040
ultimate, but the fight was won before

8401
05:31:10,320 --> 05:31:14,958
that happened and he was behind so much

8402
05:31:13,040 --> 05:31:17,040
of this game once he lost control early.

8403
05:31:14,958 --> 05:31:18,558
So he couldn't actually do big damage.

8404
05:31:17,040 --> 05:31:19,920
And in that fight, you know, especially

8405
05:31:18,558 --> 05:31:21,360
with how quickly those types of fights

8406
05:31:19,920 --> 05:31:23,520
can break out when a flank like that

8407
05:31:21,360 --> 05:31:24,718
happens from Morgan, if you're in zonas

8408
05:31:23,520 --> 05:31:26,558
during the fight, you're not doing any

8409
05:31:24,718 --> 05:31:27,840
of that late game as damage. So, it

8410
05:31:26,558 --> 05:31:28,958
doesn't really matter what items you

8411
05:31:27,840 --> 05:31:30,718
have. It doesn't really matter how good

8412
05:31:28,958 --> 05:31:32,400
your scaling is if you're just sitting

8413
05:31:30,718 --> 05:31:33,600
golden while the rest of your team falls

8414
05:31:32,400 --> 05:31:36,160
apart. I mean, the big difference

8415
05:31:33,600 --> 05:31:38,558
between game one and game two is Bro

8416
05:31:36,160 --> 05:31:40,080
didn't actually int for objective. Even

8417
05:31:38,558 --> 05:31:41,920
though you miss the Nasher, even though

8418
05:31:40,080 --> 05:31:44,000
you didn't have the lead on the Drake

8419
05:31:41,920 --> 05:31:45,600
stacks, they don't care control about

8420
05:31:44,000 --> 05:31:47,120
the map control. I mean, just take care

8421
05:31:45,600 --> 05:31:48,958
about the map control and vision

8422
05:31:47,120 --> 05:31:50,798
control. They just take the better fight

8423
05:31:48,958 --> 05:31:52,320
and objective didn't mean anything if

8424
05:31:50,798 --> 05:31:54,240
you're winning the fight.

8425
05:31:52,320 --> 05:31:55,440
Yep. Not by the end of that game. Well,

8426
05:31:54,240 --> 05:31:56,798
we're done here on the space for now.

8427
05:31:55,440 --> 05:32:00,558
Now, let's go back to the casters for

8428
05:31:56,798 --> 05:32:02,558
the final game of the night.

8429
05:32:00,558 --> 05:32:05,520
Thank you so much, Valdez. And it's a

8430
05:32:02,558 --> 05:32:07,120
little bit sad that it is the final game

8431
05:32:05,520 --> 05:32:12,638
because think about it. If this was a

8432
05:32:07,120 --> 05:32:16,000
best of five, we could have three more.

8433
05:32:12,638 --> 05:32:19,120
I can only dream

8434
05:32:16,000 --> 05:32:22,080
of what conversational topics we would

8435
05:32:19,120 --> 05:32:24,000
hit in a best of five between Bro and

8436
05:32:22,080 --> 05:32:26,400
DRX. I actually think I'm going to bring

8437
05:32:24,000 --> 05:32:28,638
this up with the LCK commission. What if

8438
05:32:26,400 --> 05:32:30,958
we did it so that like cuz we have like

8439
05:32:28,638 --> 05:32:32,638
five rounds, right? Why don't we make it

8440
05:32:30,958 --> 05:32:33,280
so that round three is just best of

8441
05:32:32,638 --> 05:32:35,040
fives?

8442
05:32:33,280 --> 05:32:38,558
Well, you know, we are getting playins

8443
05:32:35,040 --> 05:32:40,160
and like I think only the only the 10th

8444
05:32:38,558 --> 05:32:43,280
team is not in

8445
05:32:40,160 --> 05:32:44,400
that's ninth and 10th, right?

8446
05:32:43,280 --> 05:32:46,958
I'm going to have to check. Might be

8447
05:32:44,400 --> 05:32:48,638
ninth and 10th. Either way, I think it's

8448
05:32:46,958 --> 05:32:50,080
better with nine. That sounds more fun.

8449
05:32:48,638 --> 05:32:51,680
That being said, it'd be harder to find

8450
05:32:50,080 --> 05:32:53,760
the matchups unless you run it gauntlet

8451
05:32:51,680 --> 05:32:56,000
style, which we have done in the past. I

8452
05:32:53,760 --> 05:32:57,920
need to just do a bit of a refresh on on

8453
05:32:56,000 --> 05:32:59,360
the on the bracket and what it's going

8454
05:32:57,920 --> 05:33:01,120
to look like cuz things have all

8455
05:32:59,360 --> 05:33:03,040
changed.

8456
05:33:01,120 --> 05:33:05,280
And now let's see how things change in

8457
05:33:03,040 --> 05:33:07,280
this draft because we are fearless. And

8458
05:33:05,280 --> 05:33:09,920
honestly,

8459
05:33:07,280 --> 05:33:13,280
that is the word of the night. These

8460
05:33:09,920 --> 05:33:14,400
teams, both of them, fearless

8461
05:33:13,280 --> 05:33:16,240
probably should have been a bit more

8462
05:33:14,400 --> 05:33:18,480
fearful in both of these games certain

8463
05:33:16,240 --> 05:33:19,760
points.

8464
05:33:18,480 --> 05:33:21,600
But let's see how it is going to go here

8465
05:33:19,760 --> 05:33:23,440
in game number three when it is all on

8466
05:33:21,600 --> 05:33:26,000
the line. The Bros, they've done this

8467
05:33:23,440 --> 05:33:28,798
before. They did it two days ago. They

8468
05:33:26,000 --> 05:33:31,440
took down DK in a reverse sweep best of

8469
05:33:28,798 --> 05:33:33,920
three style. You are correct by the way.

8470
05:33:31,440 --> 05:33:36,320
I think it's the um

8471
05:33:33,920 --> 05:33:37,760
it it's number one, two, and three. So 9

8472
05:33:36,320 --> 05:33:39,840
and 10 are out. Y

8473
05:33:37,760 --> 05:33:42,080
So that means that we probably won't be

8474
05:33:39,840 --> 05:33:43,680
see cuz I think one of these two teams

8475
05:33:42,080 --> 05:33:45,840
it's probably going to be in ninth.

8476
05:33:43,680 --> 05:33:49,120
Might be BNK.

8477
05:33:45,840 --> 05:33:51,520
It could theoretically still be DK. Uh

8478
05:33:49,120 --> 05:33:52,240
depending on how collapsed you truly

8479
05:33:51,520 --> 05:33:54,160
think they are.

8480
05:33:52,240 --> 05:33:54,320
You'd have to colossally collapse, I

8481
05:33:54,160 --> 05:33:55,840
think.

8482
05:33:54,320 --> 05:33:57,440
Well, no. They're like 10 points ahead

8483
05:33:55,840 --> 05:33:59,120
of everyone else. Yeah. Like we're not

8484
05:33:57,440 --> 05:34:03,440
talking just a normal collapse. We're

8485
05:33:59,120 --> 05:34:06,480
talking we're talking big big collapse.

8486
05:34:03,440 --> 05:34:09,280
And we do have uh just confirmation that

8487
05:34:06,480 --> 05:34:12,480
uh 9th and 10th are both out

8488
05:34:09,280 --> 05:34:15,200
as we just learned. Good to know that I

8489
05:34:12,480 --> 05:34:17,200
at least remembered that.

8490
05:34:15,200 --> 05:34:19,360
And once you're in planes, you can do

8491
05:34:17,200 --> 05:34:20,400
whatever you can dream of. You know, you

8492
05:34:19,360 --> 05:34:21,280
can make it all the way.

8493
05:34:20,400 --> 05:34:23,520
Exactly.

8494
05:34:21,280 --> 05:34:24,160
It is possible. You could go on a run,

8495
05:34:23,520 --> 05:34:27,040
Atlas.

8496
05:34:24,160 --> 05:34:29,840
Oh, the Brun. Imagine it.

8497
05:34:27,040 --> 05:34:32,000
The Brun. Oh my goodness. Oh, that

8498
05:34:29,840 --> 05:34:34,480
reminds me of that really cute TV show

8499
05:34:32,000 --> 05:34:35,120
with the car called Brum. Do you

8500
05:34:34,480 --> 05:34:37,840
remember?

8501
05:34:35,120 --> 05:34:39,920
What is the recent greatest? Is it Is it

8502
05:34:37,840 --> 05:34:41,280
Well, it's DRX, actually. Never mind.

8503
05:34:39,920 --> 05:34:42,400
Like, what is the greatest run? Like, is

8504
05:34:41,280 --> 05:34:43,200
it home? No, it's DRX.

8505
05:34:42,400 --> 05:34:45,840
It's just DRX.

8506
05:34:43,200 --> 05:34:46,400
It's just DRX. Yeah, never mind. Huh.

8507
05:34:45,840 --> 05:34:47,840
Kind of.

8508
05:34:46,400 --> 05:34:49,360
It's kind of frustrating, isn't it? Cuz

8509
05:34:47,840 --> 05:34:51,360
that'll never be topped and so it's just

8510
05:34:49,360 --> 05:34:52,718
always DRX from now on.

8511
05:34:51,360 --> 05:34:54,320
Well, it's cuz they won. I think

8512
05:34:52,718 --> 05:34:56,080
otherwise Hanwa might have actually get

8513
05:34:54,320 --> 05:34:58,798
if it if they both ended in the same

8514
05:34:56,080 --> 05:35:00,400
place. I think the Hanwa run might have

8515
05:34:58,798 --> 05:35:01,920
still been crazier.

8516
05:35:00,400 --> 05:35:04,958
True. But

8517
05:35:01,920 --> 05:35:06,878
the 2021, but again, I'm not trying to

8518
05:35:04,958 --> 05:35:07,600
argue this cuz it is DRX. We both know

8519
05:35:06,878 --> 05:35:10,878
this

8520
05:35:07,600 --> 05:35:12,958
for a fact as we are. You know, normally

8521
05:35:10,878 --> 05:35:15,520
this early rail pryo I'm not a fan, but

8522
05:35:12,958 --> 05:35:17,840
Alistar is out and it is Palo. So I

8523
05:35:15,520 --> 05:35:20,000
actually I'm down with it. I respect it.

8524
05:35:17,840 --> 05:35:21,760
I like it as the rise is picked up here

8525
05:35:20,000 --> 05:35:23,680
for Yahoo. What is closer going to play

8526
05:35:21,760 --> 05:35:25,600
into it? I'm not sure about first pick

8527
05:35:23,680 --> 05:35:25,920
rise. Doesn't make me feel fantastic,

8528
05:35:25,600 --> 05:35:27,360
but

8529
05:35:25,920 --> 05:35:29,360
it did win in uh

8530
05:35:27,360 --> 05:35:31,760
that's true in the previous series.

8531
05:35:29,360 --> 05:35:33,360
There's the Cassiopia and that was not

8532
05:35:31,760 --> 05:35:37,120
what was picked

8533
05:35:33,360 --> 05:35:39,120
by Chovi in our last series. So this

8534
05:35:37,120 --> 05:35:41,920
time the snake lady. We got horse pants

8535
05:35:39,120 --> 05:35:43,600
and snake lady. It's very, very cool

8536
05:35:41,920 --> 05:35:45,440
stuff as Sponge and Yahoo. What are we

8537
05:35:43,600 --> 05:35:48,000
going to be locking away here to augment

8538
05:35:45,440 --> 05:35:49,600
this composition? Jungle Pool is looking

8539
05:35:48,000 --> 05:35:51,680
a little thin, especially after the

8540
05:35:49,600 --> 05:35:53,920
Nocturn and Pantheon were both banned

8541
05:35:51,680 --> 05:35:55,840
away.

8542
05:35:53,920 --> 05:35:58,000
We'll see where Sponge is going to go as

8543
05:35:55,840 --> 05:36:01,200
the Rakan is a consideration likely the

8544
05:35:58,000 --> 05:36:04,000
Zire to follow. Teddy is big advocate

8545
05:36:01,200 --> 05:36:06,240
for Zia. Always has been. Still, they

8546
05:36:04,000 --> 05:36:07,840
could go with something else. This could

8547
05:36:06,240 --> 05:36:08,320
be just them making sure they have some

8548
05:36:07,840 --> 05:36:11,680
engage.

8549
05:36:08,320 --> 05:36:13,200
I think Aaya does run into Jinx.

8550
05:36:11,680 --> 05:36:14,400
Could see that come through. I like this

8551
05:36:13,200 --> 05:36:14,958
a lot actually.

8552
05:36:14,400 --> 05:36:17,840
Yeah,

8553
05:36:14,958 --> 05:36:20,160
Charvin combined with Vakan really

8554
05:36:17,840 --> 05:36:21,680
strong. Also takes away a lot of the

8555
05:36:20,160 --> 05:36:23,040
strong AD carries that you want to go at

8556
05:36:21,680 --> 05:36:25,760
this point in the game. Right. Lucian's

8557
05:36:23,040 --> 05:36:26,958
out. Ezreal's out. Can go Zia, but

8558
05:36:25,760 --> 05:36:28,400
you'll still be stuck.

8559
05:36:26,958 --> 05:36:30,160
Yep.

8560
05:36:28,400 --> 05:36:31,120
can't exactly fly over that wall play

8561
05:36:30,160 --> 05:36:32,718
here

8562
05:36:31,120 --> 05:36:34,080
cuz you want something that can kind of

8563
05:36:32,718 --> 05:36:35,920
deal.

8564
05:36:34,080 --> 05:36:37,680
You could know.

8565
05:36:35,920 --> 05:36:40,080
So you could actually, funnily enough,

8566
05:36:37,680 --> 05:36:43,120
you could go Renekton, go an AD m

8567
05:36:40,080 --> 05:36:44,480
jungler and just go Ziggs. I'm not even

8568
05:36:43,120 --> 05:36:44,958
joking.

8569
05:36:44,480 --> 05:36:47,440
True.

8570
05:36:44,958 --> 05:36:49,680
Like Zigs into like if he ult you just

8571
05:36:47,440 --> 05:36:50,480
ult yourself and then uh Satchel and

8572
05:36:49,680 --> 05:36:51,120
then he dies.

8573
05:36:50,480 --> 05:36:53,440
Yep.

8574
05:36:51,120 --> 05:36:55,760
I could see it. I I wouldn't hate it

8575
05:36:53,440 --> 05:36:58,080
actually more I think about it. see

8576
05:36:55,760 --> 05:37:00,080
where the hype does want to go there.

8577
05:36:58,080 --> 05:37:01,600
And then what's the AD jungle that you

8578
05:37:00,080 --> 05:37:03,440
do decide to pick alongside it? Is it

8579
05:37:01,600 --> 05:37:05,440
like a Viego or a Zed? I guess Zed's a

8580
05:37:03,440 --> 05:37:08,240
bit flavor of the month at the moment.

8581
05:37:05,440 --> 05:37:10,400
I wouldn't mind Zed. What else do we

8582
05:37:08,240 --> 05:37:10,718
still have open? Pantheon's out. Knock

8583
05:37:10,400 --> 05:37:12,480
out.

8584
05:37:10,718 --> 05:37:14,320
Fury. Haven't seen the Fury in a while.

8585
05:37:12,480 --> 05:37:15,120
Yeah, I think the Fury is kind of bad.

8586
05:37:14,320 --> 05:37:18,080
Probably a Bri.

8587
05:37:15,120 --> 05:37:19,680
They They actually make the Okay, let's

8588
05:37:18,080 --> 05:37:21,760
They actually make the read like this a

8589
05:37:19,680 --> 05:37:24,240
lot. The Zban I think is very warranted.

8590
05:37:21,760 --> 05:37:25,600
like it.

8591
05:37:24,240 --> 05:37:26,240
This jungle pool is going to get well

8592
05:37:25,600 --> 05:37:27,920
and truly

8593
05:37:26,240 --> 05:37:29,120
it is.

8594
05:37:27,920 --> 05:37:30,400
There's going to be something that we're

8595
05:37:29,120 --> 05:37:32,320
not thinking of right now that's like

8596
05:37:30,400 --> 05:37:33,840
super obvious.

8597
05:37:32,320 --> 05:37:36,878
Oh god.

8598
05:37:33,840 --> 05:37:40,480
What? Wait, what?

8599
05:37:36,878 --> 05:37:41,760
It's Lee. Oh my god, you're right. Can't

8600
05:37:40,480 --> 05:37:44,798
believe we're not thinking the most

8601
05:37:41,760 --> 05:37:47,680
arguably the most iconic jungler ever.

8602
05:37:44,798 --> 05:37:49,520
Is it not that we should be considering

8603
05:37:47,680 --> 05:37:51,280
creating carries though? Because like

8604
05:37:49,520 --> 05:37:53,280
maybe it's a Kaiser. You could

8605
05:37:51,280 --> 05:37:54,400
theoretically Kai your way out of a

8606
05:37:53,280 --> 05:37:56,080
cataclysm.

8607
05:37:54,400 --> 05:37:58,160
You could Kaisa. Yeah, I think Kaiser

8608
05:37:56,080 --> 05:37:59,760
works. But I do think playing Kaisen to

8609
05:37:58,160 --> 05:38:01,600
work. Okay. Oh my god.

8610
05:37:59,760 --> 05:38:03,360
Well, they're banning the Lee as well.

8611
05:38:01,600 --> 05:38:04,878
I I am really happy that I mentioned

8612
05:38:03,360 --> 05:38:06,080
both Zed and Lee and then they both got

8613
05:38:04,878 --> 05:38:08,160
banned.

8614
05:38:06,080 --> 05:38:09,520
I I do kind of that that makes me feel

8615
05:38:08,160 --> 05:38:12,080
that makes me feel good. That was nice.

8616
05:38:09,520 --> 05:38:14,400
That's It was nice. Take take the win.

8617
05:38:12,080 --> 05:38:16,000
There you go. Yeah, it's good. Well, now

8618
05:38:14,400 --> 05:38:17,120
what does uh what does Crocco play

8619
05:38:16,000 --> 05:38:18,480
though? That's the real question.

8620
05:38:17,120 --> 05:38:20,480
Maybe you just slam Ziggs here and give

8621
05:38:18,480 --> 05:38:24,120
yourself more time to think about it.

8622
05:38:20,480 --> 05:38:24,120
could do it that way.

8623
05:38:24,240 --> 05:38:28,400
Let's see. It's Crocco that we're

8624
05:38:26,160 --> 05:38:30,878
focusing on at the moment. And oh god,

8625
05:38:28,400 --> 05:38:32,638
it's my it's my train of thought. Oh no.

8626
05:38:30,878 --> 05:38:34,878
I liked yours a lot better, but instead

8627
05:38:32,638 --> 05:38:37,520
we have got the croc and the cat. And

8628
05:38:34,878 --> 05:38:40,320
it's a managerie. We've got horse, we've

8629
05:38:37,520 --> 05:38:42,718
got snake, we've got the crocodile, and

8630
05:38:40,320 --> 05:38:43,840
we got the kitty cat. So what animal can

8631
05:38:42,718 --> 05:38:46,958
be picked for the bottom lane?

8632
05:38:43,840 --> 05:38:49,760
What are we playing here as hype? You

8633
05:38:46,958 --> 05:38:50,638
can't go Ziggs anymore. Like I I really

8634
05:38:49,760 --> 05:38:53,840
no absolutely

8635
05:38:50,638 --> 05:38:56,320
there's there's no shot.

8636
05:38:53,840 --> 05:38:58,080
So what do you go cuz everything else

8637
05:38:56,320 --> 05:38:59,680
that's good runs into the Jarvin

8638
05:38:58,080 --> 05:39:01,360
problem. Do you know Teddy has played

8639
05:38:59,680 --> 05:39:02,638
the most civer in a single game out of

8640
05:39:01,360 --> 05:39:05,200
any other player on the planet?

8641
05:39:02,638 --> 05:39:07,680
Yes, I am aware.

8642
05:39:05,200 --> 05:39:08,400
I also noted killed Faker like 90

8643
05:39:07,680 --> 05:39:10,240
minutes in.

8644
05:39:08,400 --> 05:39:11,840
Did he really? What was he playing?

8645
05:39:10,240 --> 05:39:14,000
He was Kazix, wasn't it? It was and it

8646
05:39:11,840 --> 05:39:15,680
was it was into the Cassadin and it was

8647
05:39:14,000 --> 05:39:18,240
a very cool moment cuz it was the very

8648
05:39:15,680 --> 05:39:18,958
end of the game. Anyway, um we have now

8649
05:39:18,240 --> 05:39:20,798
the uh

8650
05:39:18,958 --> 05:39:21,600
going to slam like Ash or something and

8651
05:39:20,798 --> 05:39:22,320
just be unhappy

8652
05:39:21,600 --> 05:39:23,760
or just say

8653
05:39:22,320 --> 05:39:25,360
high side. Yeah, that makes sense.

8654
05:39:23,760 --> 05:39:26,878
Oh no. So like they weren't listening

8655
05:39:25,360 --> 05:39:27,840
when you were I guess they were

8656
05:39:26,878 --> 05:39:29,680
listening when you were talking about

8657
05:39:27,840 --> 05:39:30,480
the Lee and the Zed and so then they

8658
05:39:29,680 --> 05:39:32,240
banned that away.

8659
05:39:30,480 --> 05:39:32,798
Well, it's like but it makes sense cuz

8660
05:39:32,240 --> 05:39:33,680
like what?

8661
05:39:32,798 --> 05:39:33,920
Yeah. No, what else are you going to

8662
05:39:33,680 --> 05:39:35,600
play?

8663
05:39:33,920 --> 05:39:38,558
Are you going to play like Olaf? That's

8664
05:39:35,600 --> 05:39:39,920
not that's not a champion. Taran showed

8665
05:39:38,558 --> 05:39:40,240
us that unfortunately.

8666
05:39:39,920 --> 05:39:42,638
Yeah.

8667
05:39:40,240 --> 05:39:44,080
Like I think Nefair is kind of rough.

8668
05:39:42,638 --> 05:39:46,160
I'm sure again I'm sure there's stuff

8669
05:39:44,080 --> 05:39:49,120
that we can think of if you just sit

8670
05:39:46,160 --> 05:39:51,040
there and aren't casting uh one or two

8671
05:39:49,120 --> 05:39:54,558
obvious AD junglers that maybe were not

8672
05:39:51,040 --> 05:39:58,320
like Talon. Talon's kind of fun. I don't

8673
05:39:54,558 --> 05:39:59,840
hate Talon actually.

8674
05:39:58,320 --> 05:40:01,600
Owner would have picked Talon.

8675
05:39:59,840 --> 05:40:03,760
Oh no. And well Cuz would have picked

8676
05:40:01,600 --> 05:40:05,120
Viego. Okay, but that's bad. FGO is

8677
05:40:03,760 --> 05:40:07,200
actually bad though. I feel like Talon

8678
05:40:05,120 --> 05:40:09,200
actually in this spot that's like I

8679
05:40:07,200 --> 05:40:10,718
could see it. Talon Zigs I think you

8680
05:40:09,200 --> 05:40:13,360
feel better.

8681
05:40:10,718 --> 05:40:16,080
I'm worried for bro.

8682
05:40:13,360 --> 05:40:18,480
It depends how much they can play around

8683
05:40:16,080 --> 05:40:21,040
top side. I think that this is this all

8684
05:40:18,480 --> 05:40:23,520
comes down to how much Morgan can just

8685
05:40:21,040 --> 05:40:25,440
crush this lane with Crocco's help.

8686
05:40:23,520 --> 05:40:27,840
Does Kroko have his card? We don't know

8687
05:40:25,440 --> 05:40:29,520
this actually cuz right now I don't

8688
05:40:27,840 --> 05:40:30,798
think anyone besides Kenyon has the

8689
05:40:29,520 --> 05:40:32,558
card.

8690
05:40:30,798 --> 05:40:33,360
Yeah. U Peanut had it for a little bit

8691
05:40:32,558 --> 05:40:35,680
but he lost it.

8692
05:40:33,360 --> 05:40:37,040
He he definitely he does. He's no longer

8693
05:40:35,680 --> 05:40:39,520
in possession. Yeah, he he kind of

8694
05:40:37,040 --> 05:40:41,520
forgot to re-up the uh the license and

8695
05:40:39,520 --> 05:40:43,680
and lost it, unfortunately.

8696
05:40:41,520 --> 05:40:44,958
Lucid had it once upon a time. That was

8697
05:40:43,680 --> 05:40:46,878
nice.

8698
05:40:44,958 --> 05:40:49,280
Well, you've got a pretty comfy looking

8699
05:40:46,878 --> 05:40:52,718
draft here out of DRX moving into this

8700
05:40:49,280 --> 05:40:54,400
game number three and the Bros are

8701
05:40:52,718 --> 05:40:55,920
experimenting. There's certainly going

8702
05:40:54,400 --> 05:40:57,680
to be some laning prowess that they

8703
05:40:55,920 --> 05:41:01,480
might be able to find. See how it does

8704
05:40:57,680 --> 05:41:01,480
go under the rift.

8705
05:41:02,830 --> 05:41:06,330
[Applause]

8706
05:41:07,100 --> 05:41:10,798
[Music]

8707
05:41:07,790 --> 05:41:13,200
[Applause]

8708
05:41:10,798 --> 05:41:16,958
All right. Do really like the vibe in

8709
05:41:13,200 --> 05:41:19,760
here today. Both sides of L Park

8710
05:41:16,958 --> 05:41:22,080
erupting as these fan chants ring

8711
05:41:19,760 --> 05:41:24,638
through and it is late, right? It is

8712
05:41:22,080 --> 05:41:26,320
like almost quart 10. It's getting to

8713
05:41:24,638 --> 05:41:28,080
the point where it's like I'm I'm sorry.

8714
05:41:26,320 --> 05:41:29,360
We're going to have to take a cab cuz

8715
05:41:28,080 --> 05:41:32,320
we're we're not we're not going to have

8716
05:41:29,360 --> 05:41:35,360
the train to get home.

8717
05:41:32,320 --> 05:41:38,360
And the energy in this room is still

8718
05:41:35,360 --> 05:41:38,360
electrifying.

8719
05:41:38,400 --> 05:41:40,878
Many.

8720
05:41:39,120 --> 05:41:43,600
There is a problem though because I was

8721
05:41:40,878 --> 05:41:47,360
talking about it and we we've got horse,

8722
05:41:43,600 --> 05:41:48,878
snake, cat, crocodile, and lady and

8723
05:41:47,360 --> 05:41:51,600
Kaiser.

8724
05:41:48,878 --> 05:41:53,280
Well, Re is also a girl, right? So, I I

8725
05:41:51,600 --> 05:41:54,958
know she is metal horse pet.

8726
05:41:53,280 --> 05:41:56,240
Oh, it's not it's not actually a horse

8727
05:41:54,958 --> 05:41:58,558
though. I know, but you can you can get

8728
05:41:56,240 --> 05:42:00,160
with like I mean Azir is also not

8729
05:41:58,558 --> 05:42:02,878
Is it Isn't Isn't

8730
05:42:00,160 --> 05:42:04,320
okay is a pigeon.

8731
05:42:02,878 --> 05:42:06,558
Okay, fair enough. Yeah, but doesn't

8732
05:42:04,320 --> 05:42:09,600
Kaisa isn't the thing isn't it like a

8733
05:42:06,558 --> 05:42:12,160
venom situation? Isn't the thing alive?

8734
05:42:09,600 --> 05:42:14,160
Oh, yeah. But it's not really It's like

8735
05:42:12,160 --> 05:42:16,320
it's a void creature, but it is alive.

8736
05:42:14,160 --> 05:42:17,680
We were in a bit of like a farmyard type

8737
05:42:16,320 --> 05:42:20,080
vibe or at least a zoo.

8738
05:42:17,680 --> 05:42:22,558
Yeah. What would you have picked though?

8739
05:42:20,080 --> 05:42:24,558
Cogmore, cuz then you can be pug and

8740
05:42:22,558 --> 05:42:26,240
then you're a doggo. Well, Corki uh was

8741
05:42:24,558 --> 05:42:28,798
banned cuz it was fearless, right?

8742
05:42:26,240 --> 05:42:31,680
What about 80 carry Nasses cuz then he

8743
05:42:28,798 --> 05:42:33,200
could have a dog. 80 carry Renekton.

8744
05:42:31,680 --> 05:42:35,200
Sorry, not Renekton. Rengar,

8745
05:42:33,200 --> 05:42:36,958
you are losing me. Atlas, these are just

8746
05:42:35,200 --> 05:42:37,440
the animals that you could have picked.

8747
05:42:36,958 --> 05:42:39,680
No,

8748
05:42:37,440 --> 05:42:40,000
it would have been double cat if it's if

8749
05:42:39,680 --> 05:42:41,840
it's

8750
05:42:40,000 --> 05:42:44,240
Well, Zia was not it, but Zia was fine.

8751
05:42:41,840 --> 05:42:45,680
Yeah, they had to crash down here

8752
05:42:44,240 --> 05:42:47,280
towards the bottom side as Paulo does

8753
05:42:45,680 --> 05:42:50,080
find a nice little stun onto handle who

8754
05:42:47,280 --> 05:42:51,840
finds nothing with the grand entrance.

8755
05:42:50,080 --> 05:42:53,520
So, it's decent. But Teddy is still full

8756
05:42:51,840 --> 05:42:56,480
health and he's just bouncing these

8757
05:42:53,520 --> 05:42:58,718
Beyblades all over the lane. And the

8758
05:42:56,480 --> 05:43:01,920
Bros realize they're going to need a few

8759
05:42:58,718 --> 05:43:04,080
more bandages here in this bottom lane.

8760
05:43:01,920 --> 05:43:05,680
Also, hype going for Ghost. Not going

8761
05:43:04,080 --> 05:43:07,920
for uh

8762
05:43:05,680 --> 05:43:09,360
Andy more defense if they use it. Yeah,

8763
05:43:07,920 --> 05:43:11,520
they got a good amount of damage down,

8764
05:43:09,360 --> 05:43:13,040
but unless they get damage down on Teddy

8765
05:43:11,520 --> 05:43:15,600
as well, it's a bit rough. I do think

8766
05:43:13,040 --> 05:43:17,360
that early on Kais has way more damage

8767
05:43:15,600 --> 05:43:20,000
thanks to her passive and her Q than

8768
05:43:17,360 --> 05:43:22,718
Civer does. Lethal Tempo as well here

8769
05:43:20,000 --> 05:43:25,680
for hype mid lane match up closer known

8770
05:43:22,718 --> 05:43:27,280
as a very mechanically minded mid laner.

8771
05:43:25,680 --> 05:43:28,878
There's a reason right if you get make

8772
05:43:27,280 --> 05:43:29,600
your name on champions like Aurelia and

8773
05:43:28,878 --> 05:43:30,080
Akali.

8774
05:43:29,600 --> 05:43:33,280
Yeah.

8775
05:43:30,080 --> 05:43:35,040
Um those are really mechanic champions

8776
05:43:33,280 --> 05:43:36,798
first and for as

8777
05:43:35,040 --> 05:43:38,558
yeah if that passive gets perks he would

8778
05:43:36,798 --> 05:43:40,798
have been in a bit of a rough spot but I

8779
05:43:38,558 --> 05:43:43,040
guess he's fine. And the thing is like

8780
05:43:40,798 --> 05:43:45,120
Endor just makes himself a target and

8781
05:43:43,040 --> 05:43:46,160
then while they're busy trying to kill

8782
05:43:45,120 --> 05:43:48,718
him,

8783
05:43:46,160 --> 05:43:50,240
Teddy is just hitting them with buttons.

8784
05:43:48,718 --> 05:43:52,320
Boomerang Blade comes down. He's just

8785
05:43:50,240 --> 05:43:54,638
walking at them. He's just walking at

8786
05:43:52,320 --> 05:43:56,400
them. Crocco is here looking for a bit

8787
05:43:54,638 --> 05:43:59,400
of an angle. But remember, I mean,

8788
05:43:56,400 --> 05:43:59,400
Spongeb

8789
05:44:01,520 --> 05:44:06,558
to be so incredibly careful. Crocco just

8790
05:44:04,320 --> 05:44:08,798
going to look for the crab. And Hype

8791
05:44:06,558 --> 05:44:10,718
needs to be really careful. These little

8792
05:44:08,798 --> 05:44:12,558
pizzas are really getting scary. I know

8793
05:44:10,718 --> 05:44:14,480
that's not the skin he's using. In fact,

8794
05:44:12,558 --> 05:44:18,160
Teddy using a very weird skin. It's like

8795
05:44:14,480 --> 05:44:19,760
pack civer or like you just don't pick a

8796
05:44:18,160 --> 05:44:20,878
skin. They know about this gang by the

8797
05:44:19,760 --> 05:44:23,040
way. So, I think it's a good call from

8798
05:44:20,878 --> 05:44:25,520
Crocco to dip. Not run the risk. Would

8799
05:44:23,040 --> 05:44:29,040
have been a time waste if he did.

8800
05:44:25,520 --> 05:44:31,920
I'm not sure. I do know that um

8801
05:44:29,040 --> 05:44:33,360
I did see Krocco go for the best skin,

8802
05:44:31,920 --> 05:44:34,240
which is nice.

8803
05:44:33,360 --> 05:44:35,920
Is it the Canyon skin?

8804
05:44:34,240 --> 05:44:38,080
It's the Canyon skin. Yeah. And there's

8805
05:44:35,920 --> 05:44:38,638
also Renekton with uh Renektoy which is

8806
05:44:38,080 --> 05:44:40,320
also the best.

8807
05:44:38,638 --> 05:44:42,878
Oh yeah, Morgan. Morgan always to be

8808
05:44:40,320 --> 05:44:43,600
trusted uh to use the best Renekton skin

8809
05:44:42,878 --> 05:44:45,600
every single time.

8810
05:44:43,600 --> 05:44:48,240
Thank you. Oh, look at that.

8811
05:44:45,600 --> 05:44:50,798
Glorious.

8812
05:44:48,240 --> 05:44:52,400
Looking good as per usual.

8813
05:44:50,798 --> 05:44:54,798
Crocco is just going to wrap around, get

8814
05:44:52,400 --> 05:44:57,680
some traps in, and then wait for his

8815
05:44:54,798 --> 05:44:59,120
camps. Just uh suffering from success a

8816
05:44:57,680 --> 05:45:00,878
little bit when it comes to clearing

8817
05:44:59,120 --> 05:45:02,480
things out a little bit too quickly. Not

8818
05:45:00,878 --> 05:45:03,680
going to be going overly aggressive or

8819
05:45:02,480 --> 05:45:05,760
anything like that. Looking for counter

8820
05:45:03,680 --> 05:45:09,280
gang, counter jungling this stage of the

8821
05:45:05,760 --> 05:45:11,600
game. So the pathing a little measured a

8822
05:45:09,280 --> 05:45:13,360
little game three here.

8823
05:45:11,600 --> 05:45:16,320
Oh, this is a long one, Atlas.

8824
05:45:13,360 --> 05:45:18,400
Oh yeah, we are we are not going anytime

8825
05:45:16,320 --> 05:45:21,360
soon. Don't you worry.

8826
05:45:18,400 --> 05:45:22,718
That means our viewers are secured.

8827
05:45:21,360 --> 05:45:25,600
Guaranteed, some might say.

8828
05:45:22,718 --> 05:45:27,360
Cannon was just missed there byus.

8829
05:45:25,600 --> 05:45:30,080
I didn't want to talk about it.

8830
05:45:27,360 --> 05:45:32,000
Um, but guaranteed pure entertainment

8831
05:45:30,080 --> 05:45:34,080
for at least the next 30 minutes.

8832
05:45:32,000 --> 05:45:36,000
Yep. And uh that is a huge advantage

8833
05:45:34,080 --> 05:45:38,558
that Teddy now has in this lane. You can

8834
05:45:36,000 --> 05:45:42,000
see he's behind in farm but ahead in

8835
05:45:38,558 --> 05:45:44,798
gold. The power of the cannon do remain

8836
05:45:42,000 --> 05:45:46,480
on the other end. It's cold season for

8837
05:45:44,798 --> 05:45:49,520
hype.

8838
05:45:46,480 --> 05:45:51,840
All right. So just uh saying we don't

8839
05:45:49,520 --> 05:45:55,200
really mind what happens in the lane.

8840
05:45:51,840 --> 05:45:56,958
This is also one of the games where I I

8841
05:45:55,200 --> 05:45:59,600
think DRX feel better about their

8842
05:45:56,958 --> 05:46:01,040
scaling, but it's not like Bros is bad,

8843
05:45:59,600 --> 05:46:03,760
you know, like between the Kai'Sa and

8844
05:46:01,040 --> 05:46:04,160
the the Kaisa Re and Casio.

8845
05:46:03,760 --> 05:46:05,120
Yep.

8846
05:46:04,160 --> 05:46:06,798
You're always going to have good

8847
05:46:05,120 --> 05:46:08,638
threats. Their front back is a lot

8848
05:46:06,798 --> 05:46:10,718
clunkier than the RX. I think the RX

8849
05:46:08,638 --> 05:46:13,280
comp is a lot more straightforward to

8850
05:46:10,718 --> 05:46:16,160
play out. I do think that Yeah, if if

8851
05:46:13,280 --> 05:46:17,920
Bro mess up the the initial salvo,

8852
05:46:16,160 --> 05:46:19,920
right, they can't get on top of Teddy.

8853
05:46:17,920 --> 05:46:21,840
Teddy just kills everyone. And I think

8854
05:46:19,920 --> 05:46:22,400
they just don't have the range to deal

8855
05:46:21,840 --> 05:46:24,000
with Civo.

8856
05:46:22,400 --> 05:46:26,320
Well, yeah, but I do think the the

8857
05:46:24,000 --> 05:46:29,200
Kaiser to me in late game is just so

8858
05:46:26,320 --> 05:46:31,120
insanely insanely strong if you can just

8859
05:46:29,200 --> 05:46:32,878
get on top of the enemy cuz your burst

8860
05:46:31,120 --> 05:46:35,040
is just

8861
05:46:32,878 --> 05:46:36,320
kind of out there. But as you say, they

8862
05:46:35,040 --> 05:46:40,160
do need to actually be cleaning their

8863
05:46:36,320 --> 05:46:42,000
setups, which bro have been. Sometimes

8864
05:46:40,160 --> 05:46:44,160
I think they know they can do it.

8865
05:46:42,000 --> 05:46:45,760
Sometimes they decide not to do it.

8866
05:46:44,160 --> 05:46:46,240
Oh, it's all up it's all choice.

8867
05:46:45,760 --> 05:46:49,040
Yeah. Well,

8868
05:46:46,240 --> 05:46:50,320
they believe in the broth whenever they

8869
05:46:49,040 --> 05:46:51,920
lose. It's just their choice.

8870
05:46:50,320 --> 05:46:53,440
They just they get the statement back

8871
05:46:51,920 --> 05:46:55,920
like how much tax is actually being

8872
05:46:53,440 --> 05:46:59,920
accured. If there's not enough,

8873
05:46:55,920 --> 05:47:02,878
then you know, let's just run it down.

8874
05:46:59,920 --> 05:47:04,638
If there is enough, they perfectly set

8875
05:47:02,878 --> 05:47:06,878
up. They find the angles. They fight

8876
05:47:04,638 --> 05:47:09,200
back from any deficit and they bring us

8877
05:47:06,878 --> 05:47:10,798
to a three game series. Hollow

8878
05:47:09,200 --> 05:47:13,920
finds a shattering strike onto Teddy's

8879
05:47:10,798 --> 05:47:15,680
spell shield and will just now vacate

8880
05:47:13,920 --> 05:47:16,958
the area. Got a bit of a back coming on

8881
05:47:15,680 --> 05:47:20,000
through there as the void seeker does

8882
05:47:16,958 --> 05:47:21,920
find that one melee minion

8883
05:47:20,000 --> 05:47:23,760
and the ghost back off cool down the

8884
05:47:21,920 --> 05:47:26,080
heal the same thing. Everything

8885
05:47:23,760 --> 05:47:28,320
equalized but

8886
05:47:26,080 --> 05:47:29,840
it is just a bit of a potential lane

8887
05:47:28,320 --> 05:47:31,440
swap angle. Never mind just going for a

8888
05:47:29,840 --> 05:47:34,240
reset. So not going to be swapping these

8889
05:47:31,440 --> 05:47:36,798
lanes at this point in time.

8890
05:47:34,240 --> 05:47:38,000
It's brewing brew.

8891
05:47:36,798 --> 05:47:40,638
It's game three Atlas.

8892
05:47:38,000 --> 05:47:43,440
We do be brewing.

8893
05:47:40,638 --> 05:47:45,840
That is the case. Morgan up here on this

8894
05:47:43,440 --> 05:47:47,600
top side though alone for now. Rich is

8895
05:47:45,840 --> 05:47:49,840
just passing by. Didn't actually use

8896
05:47:47,600 --> 05:47:53,600
teleport. Neither did Morgan as he went

8897
05:47:49,840 --> 05:47:55,760
back and got some uh steel caps.

8898
05:47:53,600 --> 05:47:58,718
And yeah, we are just very calmly

8899
05:47:55,760 --> 05:48:00,718
pingponging the waves back and forth.

8900
05:47:58,718 --> 05:48:03,440
You want to hear my smoothie story from

8901
05:48:00,718 --> 05:48:05,760
Please tell me the smoothie story.

8902
05:48:03,440 --> 05:48:07,360
Uh so it was me and uh and Mr. Daniel

8903
05:48:05,760 --> 05:48:08,718
Draos and it was the I think it was the

8904
05:48:07,360 --> 05:48:11,280
day of of finals.

8905
05:48:08,718 --> 05:48:13,200
Mhm. That was the day you kind of looked

8906
05:48:11,280 --> 05:48:15,680
like uh looked like a vampire, right?

8907
05:48:13,200 --> 05:48:17,280
So, what I was going for was uh Florence

8908
05:48:15,680 --> 05:48:19,040
Pew and Thunderbolts, but instead it

8909
05:48:17,280 --> 05:48:20,480
looked like evil Peter Parker from

8910
05:48:19,040 --> 05:48:22,798
Spider-Man 3.

8911
05:48:20,480 --> 05:48:24,320
It definitely did give off those vibes.

8912
05:48:22,798 --> 05:48:26,718
Yeah, it was it was good. It was fun. I

8913
05:48:24,320 --> 05:48:28,320
I I always enjoyed doing the the type of

8914
05:48:26,718 --> 05:48:29,120
stuff just uh you know,

8915
05:48:28,320 --> 05:48:30,718
keep it interesting.

8916
05:48:29,120 --> 05:48:32,798
Why Yeah, why not, right? Might as well.

8917
05:48:30,718 --> 05:48:34,080
We're on camera. Fun to play around with

8918
05:48:32,798 --> 05:48:37,200
a little bit. I didn't think it looked

8919
05:48:34,080 --> 05:48:39,760
particularly uh again skill issue on my

8920
05:48:37,200 --> 05:48:42,400
end. Makeup did a wonderful job. Uh but

8921
05:48:39,760 --> 05:48:43,920
on that day, we got a there was this

8922
05:48:42,400 --> 05:48:45,120
place called uh I forgot what the name

8923
05:48:43,920 --> 05:48:46,558
was, but it was basically like, you

8924
05:48:45,120 --> 05:48:47,360
know, like a healthy food store and they

8925
05:48:46,558 --> 05:48:48,000
did smoothies.

8926
05:48:47,360 --> 05:48:50,638
Yeah. Yeah.

8927
05:48:48,000 --> 05:48:51,920
And I got a really nice smoothie. And up

8928
05:48:50,638 --> 05:48:53,520
until that point, I only got like the

8929
05:48:51,920 --> 05:48:54,480
bowls, you know, like an acai bowl with

8930
05:48:53,520 --> 05:48:57,200
just a lot of fruit.

8931
05:48:54,480 --> 05:48:59,040
Yeah. Those stuff I I'm holding off a

8932
05:48:57,200 --> 05:49:00,240
little bit to see if we get action. I

8933
05:48:59,040 --> 05:49:02,240
don't think we'll get action. I think

8934
05:49:00,240 --> 05:49:03,600
we're very much burn brewing. And it

8935
05:49:02,240 --> 05:49:05,120
looks like we're solid.

8936
05:49:03,600 --> 05:49:06,558
Yeah. Teddy actually didn't get the memo

8937
05:49:05,120 --> 05:49:08,400
that we're not doing this.

8938
05:49:06,558 --> 05:49:10,080
No, no, no. He he does. He does. It's

8939
05:49:08,400 --> 05:49:11,600
fine.

8940
05:49:10,080 --> 05:49:14,000
He just sat there for a while longer

8941
05:49:11,600 --> 05:49:16,080
than he didn't need to. Yeah, not at

8942
05:49:14,000 --> 05:49:18,080
all. Follow with two pieces of B.

8943
05:49:16,080 --> 05:49:19,600
So I got my smoothie, but up to that

8944
05:49:18,080 --> 05:49:20,958
point I only got the balls. Draco kept

8945
05:49:19,600 --> 05:49:22,558
saying mama. I'm telling you, these

8946
05:49:20,958 --> 05:49:24,400
smoothies are amazing, you know, in

8947
05:49:22,558 --> 05:49:26,558
there. You could like slam extra fiber

8948
05:49:24,400 --> 05:49:29,200
in there, extra protein. There was just

8949
05:49:26,558 --> 05:49:31,920
a lot of lot of I think I got a mango

8950
05:49:29,200 --> 05:49:33,840
one towards the end. It was wonderful.

8951
05:49:31,920 --> 05:49:34,558
So uh I'm I'm trying to drink my

8952
05:49:33,840 --> 05:49:38,400
smoothie.

8953
05:49:34,558 --> 05:49:39,680
Uhhuh. And uh I'm like, man, this is

8954
05:49:38,400 --> 05:49:41,360
really good. And then at some point,

8955
05:49:39,680 --> 05:49:43,360
like the stroll stops working. I'm like,

8956
05:49:41,360 --> 05:49:45,120
what's happening?

8957
05:49:43,360 --> 05:49:46,958
Why why am I not getting my smoothie?

8958
05:49:45,120 --> 05:49:48,400
And I I asked Dragons, he's like, no,

8959
05:49:46,958 --> 05:49:51,040
I've never had this issue. Like, maybe

8960
05:49:48,400 --> 05:49:52,480
blow on it a little bit. So, I try to

8961
05:49:51,040 --> 05:49:54,878
blow

8962
05:49:52,480 --> 05:49:55,520
just a little bit on the stroll.

8963
05:49:54,878 --> 05:49:56,958
Oh god.

8964
05:49:55,520 --> 05:49:58,000
And I don't know if you guess what

8965
05:49:56,958 --> 05:49:59,840
happened next.

8966
05:49:58,000 --> 05:50:02,080
How much of it went all over your face

8967
05:49:59,840 --> 05:50:05,200
and how much went all over your front?

8968
05:50:02,080 --> 05:50:06,400
So I actually thanks to my cat. Oh,

8969
05:50:05,200 --> 05:50:08,080
there might bit of a dive here towards

8970
05:50:06,400 --> 05:50:09,920
the bottom side and that is just a dead

8971
05:50:08,080 --> 05:50:13,360
Sante

8972
05:50:09,920 --> 05:50:16,558
as Rich hands up in frustration

8973
05:50:13,360 --> 05:50:18,798
and I don't know. Yeah, it's so I that's

8974
05:50:16,558 --> 05:50:21,280
how I felt actually right there. Uh

8975
05:50:18,798 --> 05:50:22,718
because my entire face and my shoes I

8976
05:50:21,280 --> 05:50:24,080
actually didn't get on my shirt were

8977
05:50:22,718 --> 05:50:24,558
covered in smoothie.

8978
05:50:24,080 --> 05:50:25,680
Damn.

8979
05:50:24,558 --> 05:50:27,360
Yeah, it was it was a mess.

8980
05:50:25,680 --> 05:50:29,440
It was the perfect time to get to the

8981
05:50:27,360 --> 05:50:31,200
end of the story right as Rich got

8982
05:50:29,440 --> 05:50:31,520
smoothie all over his face as well. I

8983
05:50:31,200 --> 05:50:33,040
know

8984
05:50:31,520 --> 05:50:33,920
under the bottom lane out of turret.

8985
05:50:33,040 --> 05:50:34,878
We're going to have a look at it one

8986
05:50:33,920 --> 05:50:36,400
more time.

8987
05:50:34,878 --> 05:50:37,920
It makes sense that you'd feel safe cuz

8988
05:50:36,400 --> 05:50:40,638
you're Casante.

8989
05:50:37,920 --> 05:50:42,638
But you just these minions, man.

8990
05:50:40,638 --> 05:50:44,718
Yeah. So, so the combination of the

8991
05:50:42,638 --> 05:50:46,480
minions and also why are you you are on

8992
05:50:44,718 --> 05:50:48,798
the weak side, my friend. Just sit

8993
05:50:46,480 --> 05:50:50,320
there. The wave was coming for you. That

8994
05:50:48,798 --> 05:50:51,600
was that was why the hands were up. That

8995
05:50:50,320 --> 05:50:53,200
was an unforced error.

8996
05:50:51,600 --> 05:50:55,040
Yeah. And it's also one of these times

8997
05:50:53,200 --> 05:50:56,718
as well where you're against a Renekton.

8998
05:50:55,040 --> 05:50:58,718
I think you're feeling the pressure as

8999
05:50:56,718 --> 05:51:00,400
well to not let him get a big lead in

9000
05:50:58,718 --> 05:51:02,400
the early game. And you did that.

9001
05:51:00,400 --> 05:51:03,280
So I guess you don't really have care

9002
05:51:02,400 --> 05:51:05,040
that much, right?

9003
05:51:03,280 --> 05:51:07,280
But but he did.

9004
05:51:05,040 --> 05:51:09,280
Now he's CS down.

9005
05:51:07,280 --> 05:51:10,638
Yeah, cuz he just died and lost like two

9006
05:51:09,280 --> 05:51:12,240
waves.

9007
05:51:10,638 --> 05:51:13,840
And also Morgan doesn't seem to have

9008
05:51:12,240 --> 05:51:15,680
been put that far behind by the lane

9009
05:51:13,840 --> 05:51:16,718
swap either. He was in a 1v2 scenario

9010
05:51:15,680 --> 05:51:21,120
for quite some time.

9011
05:51:16,718 --> 05:51:23,280
So the only win for uh DRX is that Polo

9012
05:51:21,120 --> 05:51:26,080
got the kill. That's it.

9013
05:51:23,280 --> 05:51:27,040
Yeah. Well, that's a that's a positive.

9014
05:51:26,080 --> 05:51:28,320
still going to be getting to that

9015
05:51:27,040 --> 05:51:30,160
redemption a little bit earlier if

9016
05:51:28,320 --> 05:51:31,600
that's what he does decide to go for.

9017
05:51:30,160 --> 05:51:33,040
I did finish the rest of the smoothie,

9018
05:51:31,600 --> 05:51:34,798
by the way, and it was really nice.

9019
05:51:33,040 --> 05:51:36,718
I mean, mango smoothies are just good.

9020
05:51:34,798 --> 05:51:38,080
Yeah. Yeah. But it was it it was

9021
05:51:36,718 --> 05:51:40,240
gruesome. It wasn't great.

9022
05:51:38,080 --> 05:51:42,798
Tell you what really like made my life

9023
05:51:40,240 --> 05:51:44,080
better. Discovering avocado smoothies.

9024
05:51:42,798 --> 05:51:45,600
Oh, yeah. You've told me about this.

9025
05:51:44,080 --> 05:51:47,200
Avocado smoothies. Just the best place.

9026
05:51:45,600 --> 05:51:49,200
Yeah. My wife always tries to sell me an

9027
05:51:47,200 --> 05:51:50,718
avocado juice, which I think is just an

9028
05:51:49,200 --> 05:51:52,558
avocado smoothie.

9029
05:51:50,718 --> 05:51:54,240
Yeah. I don't know. It's like strawberry

9030
05:51:52,558 --> 05:51:56,080
juice. And like, isn't that just a

9031
05:51:54,240 --> 05:51:57,760
smooshed strawberry?

9032
05:51:56,080 --> 05:51:58,798
No, I think they're a lot more juicy

9033
05:51:57,760 --> 05:52:00,798
than

9034
05:51:58,798 --> 05:52:01,360
than avocados, but I think it's it's the

9035
05:52:00,798 --> 05:52:03,520
same, right?

9036
05:52:01,360 --> 05:52:05,520
Yeah. Bit of a weird situation.

9037
05:52:03,520 --> 05:52:06,160
You Australians do love avocados. I have

9038
05:52:05,520 --> 05:52:08,798
been told

9039
05:52:06,160 --> 05:52:10,638
we we are. I mean, avocado toast. Why no

9040
05:52:08,798 --> 05:52:12,878
one owns a house? All of our money on

9041
05:52:10,638 --> 05:52:14,878
avocado toast. It's absolutely true.

9042
05:52:12,878 --> 05:52:16,798
Certainly.

9043
05:52:14,878 --> 05:52:18,080
As Rich and Morgan facing off, Rich

9044
05:52:16,798 --> 05:52:19,840
actually still holding his own as we can

9045
05:52:18,080 --> 05:52:22,798
see, trying to pull things back. Does

9046
05:52:19,840 --> 05:52:24,480
have the Bramble vest at least.

9047
05:52:22,798 --> 05:52:26,080
But I think Morgan just pretty happy

9048
05:52:24,480 --> 05:52:28,798
with how this game has gone. Haven't

9049
05:52:26,080 --> 05:52:30,638
seen too much of the uh Crocco Morgan

9050
05:52:28,798 --> 05:52:32,558
combo,

9051
05:52:30,638 --> 05:52:34,400
but still relatively early days, I

9052
05:52:32,558 --> 05:52:35,680
guess. Although 12 minutes probably

9053
05:52:34,400 --> 05:52:39,120
about the time where you will have

9054
05:52:35,680 --> 05:52:42,240
wanted to have your crocodile and cat

9055
05:52:39,120 --> 05:52:43,280
lady in a somewhat uh relative vicinity.

9056
05:52:42,240 --> 05:52:45,600
Wait, he's going AD.

9057
05:52:43,280 --> 05:52:48,080
Wait, what?

9058
05:52:45,600 --> 05:52:49,680
Okay. Oh, maybe. Well, actually, it

9059
05:52:48,080 --> 05:52:52,878
might be like the Shyvana build where

9060
05:52:49,680 --> 05:52:56,558
you go Shoin into like Leandre. That's

9061
05:52:52,878 --> 05:52:58,718
kind of fun. I kind of like that.

9062
05:52:56,558 --> 05:53:00,558
Going to work here for Crocco as in goes

9063
05:52:58,718 --> 05:53:02,558
Sponge. Magnets to try and turn this

9064
05:53:00,558 --> 05:53:05,280
though as Petrifying Gaze doesn't quite

9065
05:53:02,558 --> 05:53:07,360
get the stuns and down goes Polo. The

9066
05:53:05,280 --> 05:53:10,160
spears are sort of flying all waywood

9067
05:53:07,360 --> 05:53:12,400
and closer is just dead. TRX, they

9068
05:53:10,160 --> 05:53:13,760
answer back beautifully here, but I

9069
05:53:12,400 --> 05:53:15,840
don't quite know what the plan was there

9070
05:53:13,760 --> 05:53:18,160
by the Bros.

9071
05:53:15,840 --> 05:53:20,638
I am uncertain what the plan though was

9072
05:53:18,160 --> 05:53:25,040
there. As you're saying, Atlas, I feel

9073
05:53:20,638 --> 05:53:27,520
like they blew everything into Oh. Oh,

9074
05:53:25,040 --> 05:53:28,798
well, Type is possibly also dead. Grand

9075
05:53:27,520 --> 05:53:30,000
entrance going to connect this time, but

9076
05:53:28,798 --> 05:53:31,120
he makes it underneath the turret

9077
05:53:30,000 --> 05:53:32,558
utilizing the flash.

9078
05:53:31,120 --> 05:53:34,400
Oh, that's big. If he dies as well, it

9079
05:53:32,558 --> 05:53:36,638
would have been a complete disaster.

9080
05:53:34,400 --> 05:53:37,920
Now, it's still not great, but

9081
05:53:36,638 --> 05:53:39,680
a bit of a disaster.

9082
05:53:37,920 --> 05:53:41,120
It's It's a It's Yeah. Well, can you

9083
05:53:39,680 --> 05:53:42,638
have a mouth disaster? I feel like then

9084
05:53:41,120 --> 05:53:44,400
it's just like an inconvenience, right?

9085
05:53:42,638 --> 05:53:47,040
Yeah, I guess so. But it is a big

9086
05:53:44,400 --> 05:53:51,200
inconvenience. Like we're right on the

9087
05:53:47,040 --> 05:53:53,600
verge between Mal Disaster because

9088
05:53:51,200 --> 05:53:55,760
why are we all ining? We don't need to

9089
05:53:53,600 --> 05:53:58,320
all in on the sponge here. Maybe they

9090
05:53:55,760 --> 05:54:01,120
thought they'd find a killer instinct to

9091
05:53:58,320 --> 05:54:03,360
get hype in there. We can't do that.

9092
05:54:01,120 --> 05:54:06,400
Well, if in doubt, kill rich seems to be

9093
05:54:03,360 --> 05:54:08,480
the plan here as there is the Crocco and

9094
05:54:06,400 --> 05:54:11,920
Morgan show that we were asking for. And

9095
05:54:08,480 --> 05:54:14,320
that's a 1.5k gold lead for Morgan's

9096
05:54:11,920 --> 05:54:17,440
crocodile, guys. And look, there are

9097
05:54:14,320 --> 05:54:20,480
leads on Renex we've seen in the past.

9098
05:54:17,440 --> 05:54:24,080
This is not any regular lead. This is a

9099
05:54:20,480 --> 05:54:26,958
guy who has an emote in the game

9100
05:54:24,080 --> 05:54:28,080
of this champion.

9101
05:54:26,958 --> 05:54:30,400
And we'll see what he's going to be able

9102
05:54:28,080 --> 05:54:32,958
to do. Black Cleaver is now completed as

9103
05:54:30,400 --> 05:54:34,718
Rich went all out, but then he was all

9104
05:54:32,958 --> 05:54:36,400
out of options or something.

9105
05:54:34,718 --> 05:54:38,558
I don't even know if he wins the one v

9106
05:54:36,400 --> 05:54:40,160
one is the worst part.

9107
05:54:38,558 --> 05:54:41,920
Oh, Rich, we've seen this before. This

9108
05:54:40,160 --> 05:54:45,120
man has had really good performances

9109
05:54:41,920 --> 05:54:46,080
marred by sometimes kind of giving into

9110
05:54:45,120 --> 05:54:47,440
the tail.

9111
05:54:46,080 --> 05:54:50,480
Yeah.

9112
05:54:47,440 --> 05:54:52,160
And now that that first kill

9113
05:54:50,480 --> 05:54:53,520
was not good, but I think you can come

9114
05:54:52,160 --> 05:54:55,920
back from that. The second one is I

9115
05:54:53,520 --> 05:54:57,760
think a lot more costly. We might be

9116
05:54:55,920 --> 05:54:59,120
seeing the third one. Although the niti

9117
05:54:57,760 --> 05:55:00,480
is a little bit far away and there's a

9118
05:54:59,120 --> 05:55:02,240
recan coming down to offer some

9119
05:55:00,480 --> 05:55:03,120
assistance. Yeah. Who up here towards

9120
05:55:02,240 --> 05:55:05,120
the top side?

9121
05:55:03,120 --> 05:55:08,718
Closer.

9122
05:55:05,120 --> 05:55:10,400
He is going to be really big in like 15

9123
05:55:08,718 --> 05:55:11,680
minutes cuz it looks like he's going for

9124
05:55:10,400 --> 05:55:13,360
Archangels next.

9125
05:55:11,680 --> 05:55:15,440
Yeah, he's doing the rise build. He's up

9126
05:55:13,360 --> 05:55:17,040
against Rise. Just copy the build.

9127
05:55:15,440 --> 05:55:18,558
You also really like having a bunch of

9128
05:55:17,040 --> 05:55:20,638
extra mana on Cassopia. I

9129
05:55:18,558 --> 05:55:22,320
guess I agree, but I do also think

9130
05:55:20,638 --> 05:55:23,120
you're not going to be doing any damage.

9131
05:55:22,320 --> 05:55:26,400
No.

9132
05:55:23,120 --> 05:55:28,320
And Bryce has utility

9133
05:55:26,400 --> 05:55:30,480
and you do not. Well, if you're old, but

9134
05:55:28,320 --> 05:55:32,798
like how often do we actually see that

9135
05:55:30,480 --> 05:55:34,558
as utility? Well, it looks like Purple

9136
05:55:32,798 --> 05:55:36,160
is actually going the You have the

9137
05:55:34,558 --> 05:55:38,240
Myasma. That's pretty good.

9138
05:55:36,160 --> 05:55:40,240
Yeah, it's it's fine, but I don't think

9139
05:55:38,240 --> 05:55:42,080
it warrants the champions. They're going

9140
05:55:40,240 --> 05:55:43,440
to contest. Oh, let's see whether they

9141
05:55:42,080 --> 05:55:45,760
can actually find the angle as the spear

9142
05:55:43,440 --> 05:55:47,680
is just avoided here by DRX. Teleport

9143
05:55:45,760 --> 05:55:49,600
back in from closer though as he's

9144
05:55:47,680 --> 05:55:50,718
looking for the angle. Fro needs to land

9145
05:55:49,600 --> 05:55:52,480
some of these, but he's not really

9146
05:55:50,718 --> 05:55:54,798
hitting them. And there goes the drake.

9147
05:55:52,480 --> 05:55:57,200
Void seeker going to connect onto Rich

9148
05:55:54,798 --> 05:56:00,718
and it's going to be a hex tech soul

9149
05:55:57,200 --> 05:56:02,718
this game as well. That's massive. Down

9150
05:56:00,718 --> 05:56:04,558
to 50% here as Yahoo does spot out where

9151
05:56:02,718 --> 05:56:06,638
the Renekton is.

9152
05:56:04,558 --> 05:56:10,480
One to one in Drakes. Two to two in

9153
05:56:06,638 --> 05:56:11,440
kills. That's how I like my rise group

9154
05:56:10,480 --> 05:56:16,160
matches. Atlas.

9155
05:56:11,440 --> 05:56:17,840
Oh yeah. Legend group could never.

9156
05:56:16,160 --> 05:56:20,080
All right. Uh Spear doesn't find

9157
05:56:17,840 --> 05:56:22,000
anything. Void doesn't find anything.

9158
05:56:20,080 --> 05:56:24,558
The Rift Herald is just going to be

9159
05:56:22,000 --> 05:56:26,878
secured here by DRX. Both still retain a

9160
05:56:24,558 --> 05:56:28,638
2,000 gold lead off the back end of

9161
05:56:26,878 --> 05:56:29,920
this. It's kind of crazy that they're

9162
05:56:28,638 --> 05:56:32,480
able to get that far ahead. Of course,

9163
05:56:29,920 --> 05:56:34,558
most of it is on the crocodile. And it's

9164
05:56:32,480 --> 05:56:36,798
largely because they've just taken more

9165
05:56:34,558 --> 05:56:38,958
farm. As you can see, mid lane pretty

9166
05:56:36,798 --> 05:56:42,240
even, AD carry pretty even. There's a

9167
05:56:38,958 --> 05:56:44,400
catastrophically massive gap between

9168
05:56:42,240 --> 05:56:45,680
Rich and Morgan right now. Sh. If we

9169
05:56:44,400 --> 05:56:46,240
don't talk about it too much, it's not

9170
05:56:45,680 --> 05:56:47,360
real.

9171
05:56:46,240 --> 05:56:48,000
Oh, but it is.

9172
05:56:47,360 --> 05:56:49,760
No, it is.

9173
05:56:48,000 --> 05:56:51,120
And I've talked about it a lot.

9174
05:56:49,760 --> 05:56:53,760
You do love talking about Morgan.

9175
05:56:51,120 --> 05:56:56,320
I I just I just tend to talk.

9176
05:56:53,760 --> 05:57:00,160
Wait, and actually mainly about Morgan.

9177
05:56:56,320 --> 05:57:00,958
I was about to say all goes back to 2021

9178
05:57:00,160 --> 05:57:05,120
Atlas.

9179
05:57:00,958 --> 05:57:07,680
Mhm. The Morgan Camille. I still have

9180
05:57:05,120 --> 05:57:09,200
all of the trading cards. Every single

9181
05:57:07,680 --> 05:57:10,798
Morgan trading card.

9182
05:57:09,200 --> 05:57:11,920
Oh, you know, I'm sitting on a on an

9183
05:57:10,798 --> 05:57:12,718
auntie card.

9184
05:57:11,920 --> 05:57:13,920
Oh, heck.

9185
05:57:12,718 --> 05:57:15,600
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

9186
05:57:13,920 --> 05:57:17,040
I've got my uh I've got an effort card

9187
05:57:15,600 --> 05:57:18,480
as well. I think I have like nine of

9188
05:57:17,040 --> 05:57:21,040
them. Looking forward to

9189
05:57:18,480 --> 05:57:21,840
I also have Pace, which obviously I'm

9190
05:57:21,040 --> 05:57:22,558
very happy about.

9191
05:57:21,840 --> 05:57:25,520
Yeah, that's a goodie.

9192
05:57:22,558 --> 05:57:27,040
Bunch of Zas cards. It's nice.

9193
05:57:25,520 --> 05:57:29,360
I got a Faker. I don't know whether it

9194
05:57:27,040 --> 05:57:29,920
was a like a holographic Faker like the

9195
05:57:29,360 --> 05:57:31,600
foil.

9196
05:57:29,920 --> 05:57:33,040
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got a couple of

9197
05:57:31,600 --> 05:57:34,080
foils. I just can't remember. I only

9198
05:57:33,040 --> 05:57:36,240
know that I got all of them.

9199
05:57:34,080 --> 05:57:37,840
I definitely got Pas in foil. That was

9200
05:57:36,240 --> 05:57:40,240
awesome. All right. Bit of a grand

9201
05:57:37,840 --> 05:57:41,920
entrance here from uh from Andel, but

9202
05:57:40,240 --> 05:57:43,840
it's Polo that decides to go back in

9203
05:57:41,920 --> 05:57:46,400
with the crash now. Cataclysm going to

9204
05:57:43,840 --> 05:57:49,200
come on through. Crocco just pounces his

9205
05:57:46,400 --> 05:57:50,798
way out. They do get the exhaust, so

9206
05:57:49,200 --> 05:57:52,080
there's that. But Polo can replace that

9207
05:57:50,798 --> 05:57:54,480
one pretty quickly and does so

9208
05:57:52,080 --> 05:57:56,240
immediately, in fact.

9209
05:57:54,480 --> 05:57:58,958
as we don't have an objective right now.

9210
05:57:56,240 --> 05:58:01,360
So these ults being thrown out not super

9211
05:57:58,958 --> 05:58:03,280
consequential. They are kind of starving

9212
05:58:01,360 --> 05:58:04,080
Sponge out of resources though which I

9213
05:58:03,280 --> 05:58:05,120
do like.

9214
05:58:04,080 --> 05:58:08,638
Yep.

9215
05:58:05,120 --> 05:58:10,080
Uh Morgan and Rich fighting one another.

9216
05:58:08,638 --> 05:58:12,320
There is the Black Cleaver first

9217
05:58:10,080 --> 05:58:13,680
completed here by Morgan, but thorn mail

9218
05:58:12,320 --> 05:58:16,080
still working out here for Rich.

9219
05:58:13,680 --> 05:58:18,080
I like the Black Cleaver first though.

9220
05:58:16,080 --> 05:58:20,000
And you can actually trade against

9221
05:58:18,080 --> 05:58:22,080
Casante and not go for too many autos.

9222
05:58:20,000 --> 05:58:24,320
So, it's not one of those situations

9223
05:58:22,080 --> 05:58:24,958
like if you just use E and Q, right, for

9224
05:58:24,320 --> 05:58:26,160
the trades.

9225
05:58:24,958 --> 05:58:29,280
Yep.

9226
05:58:26,160 --> 05:58:31,600
You won't be taking

9227
05:58:29,280 --> 05:58:33,600
the healing reduction until you actually

9228
05:58:31,600 --> 05:58:35,920
order. So, you can kind of trade around

9229
05:58:33,600 --> 05:58:37,440
that.

9230
05:58:35,920 --> 05:58:39,520
Hype here just trying to catch these

9231
05:58:37,440 --> 05:58:40,958
waves when they approach. Level 11s for

9232
05:58:39,520 --> 05:58:43,280
both of our AD carries. Never mind.

9233
05:58:40,958 --> 05:58:44,798
Level 12 for Teddy

9234
05:58:43,280 --> 05:58:46,558
who's doing a great job. Just continuing

9235
05:58:44,798 --> 05:58:48,718
to be Civer, right? Wants to be getting

9236
05:58:46,558 --> 05:58:51,280
to three items as soon as possible. Oh,

9237
05:58:48,718 --> 05:58:53,520
he knows he is the saver guy.

9238
05:58:51,280 --> 05:58:58,000
We have off a tool about

9239
05:58:53,520 --> 05:58:59,520
may have you do. Yeah,

9240
05:58:58,000 --> 05:59:01,120
but going to be a little while. Isn't

9241
05:58:59,520 --> 05:59:02,718
going to go for infinity edge second or

9242
05:59:01,120 --> 05:59:04,400
anything like that. Can kind of do that

9243
05:59:02,718 --> 05:59:05,520
and get away with it, but who wants some

9244
05:59:04,400 --> 05:59:06,558
attack speed in the build,

9245
05:59:05,520 --> 05:59:07,280
especially in this game.

9246
05:59:06,558 --> 05:59:08,878
Oh yeah.

9247
05:59:07,280 --> 05:59:11,840
So, how many people in chat do you think

9248
05:59:08,878 --> 05:59:13,120
are making the Casio Piano Boots joke?

9249
05:59:11,840 --> 05:59:15,680
Oh, yeah. That's a good point. Let's

9250
05:59:13,120 --> 05:59:17,760
check. There's always one.

9251
05:59:15,680 --> 05:59:19,680
I can't see. If not, if not Twitch chat,

9252
05:59:17,760 --> 05:59:21,200
you're letting us down. You know, you

9253
05:59:19,680 --> 05:59:23,280
have one job. Well, you don't. You get

9254
05:59:21,200 --> 05:59:25,040
There's just a bunch of people standing

9255
05:59:23,280 --> 05:59:27,280
up for Rich and what he's trying to

9256
05:59:25,040 --> 05:59:31,080
achieve. I appreciate that. He is a good

9257
05:59:27,280 --> 05:59:31,080
dude by all accounts.

9258
05:59:31,120 --> 05:59:35,600
All right. Well, Crocco going to be

9259
05:59:33,040 --> 05:59:37,520
taking this crab. And the Bros retaining

9260
05:59:35,600 --> 05:59:40,240
control of the map. They are slowly

9261
05:59:37,520 --> 05:59:41,840
getting further and further ahead, which

9262
05:59:40,240 --> 05:59:44,320
most of that gold is just on the

9263
05:59:41,840 --> 05:59:48,080
crocodile. Um, but let's not kid

9264
05:59:44,320 --> 05:59:49,920
ourselves. A very fed Renekton with a

9265
05:59:48,080 --> 05:59:52,480
next drake coming up. Uh, is a pretty

9266
05:59:49,920 --> 05:59:54,160
big deal as Paulo gets the blue.

9267
05:59:52,480 --> 05:59:55,200
So going for a Zeke. Haven't seen that

9268
05:59:54,160 --> 05:59:56,400
in a while.

9269
05:59:55,200 --> 05:59:58,958
That's an odd move.

9270
05:59:56,400 --> 06:00:01,520
Two items done for Teddy now. Not quite

9271
05:59:58,958 --> 06:00:04,160
there yet for hype, but he is probably

9272
06:00:01,520 --> 06:00:06,000
going to look to get that on his cuz did

9273
06:00:04,160 --> 06:00:08,558
cash out the call on the next wave.

9274
06:00:06,000 --> 06:00:10,000
Maybe he needs the base cuz he needs to

9275
06:00:08,558 --> 06:00:11,840
get a second item before this drake

9276
06:00:10,000 --> 06:00:13,760
contest comes through. He does have a

9277
06:00:11,840 --> 06:00:14,798
few moments uh in order to do it. So if

9278
06:00:13,760 --> 06:00:17,120
he does go back now,

9279
06:00:14,798 --> 06:00:19,360
yeah, there's the skates actually fine.

9280
06:00:17,120 --> 06:00:20,718
Uh does he have the money though?

9281
06:00:19,360 --> 06:00:22,958
Well, that's the main thing. Needs a

9282
06:00:20,718 --> 06:00:24,798
quick cloak and a complete the uh

9283
06:00:22,958 --> 06:00:27,520
recipe. So maybe not. He did buy

9284
06:00:24,798 --> 06:00:30,000
relatively recently.

9285
06:00:27,520 --> 06:00:31,280
That's that's big.

9286
06:00:30,000 --> 06:00:34,160
Apollo tping in.

9287
06:00:31,280 --> 06:00:35,680
Um he does have his merk treads now

9288
06:00:34,160 --> 06:00:37,360
complete.

9289
06:00:35,680 --> 06:00:40,160
Remember

9290
06:00:37,360 --> 06:00:41,680
the next kill, that's what secures feats

9291
06:00:40,160 --> 06:00:43,040
of strength as well.

9292
06:00:41,680 --> 06:00:46,000
Any sort of pick is going to be even

9293
06:00:43,040 --> 06:00:47,440
more meaningful for either team

9294
06:00:46,000 --> 06:00:49,280
as it's going to be upgrading their

9295
06:00:47,440 --> 06:00:51,360
shoes. Closer's shoes not going to be

9296
06:00:49,280 --> 06:00:52,638
upgraded, but Cassiopia still gets a bit

9297
06:00:51,360 --> 06:00:55,760
upgraded. It's okay.

9298
06:00:52,638 --> 06:00:58,400
Teddy is so big, I think, with the two

9299
06:00:55,760 --> 06:01:00,000
item spike on the AD carry.

9300
06:00:58,400 --> 06:01:02,798
Oh,

9301
06:01:00,000 --> 06:01:04,558
sometimes you just want to press R.

9302
06:01:02,798 --> 06:01:07,440
Yeah, I think he was trying to predict

9303
06:01:04,558 --> 06:01:09,280
Sponge's EQ and then he just didn't.

9304
06:01:07,440 --> 06:01:10,240
Yeah, that was a bit weird. Well, Closer

9305
06:01:09,280 --> 06:01:12,080
is going to stand his ground here.

9306
06:01:10,240 --> 06:01:13,520
Myasma does go down as Andiel not going

9307
06:01:12,080 --> 06:01:15,040
to be dashing off that one, but he still

9308
06:01:13,520 --> 06:01:16,240
takes a lot of damage. Crocco getting

9309
06:01:15,040 --> 06:01:18,080
out of there because he does the same

9310
06:01:16,240 --> 06:01:20,958
thing. Primal Surge might be able to

9311
06:01:18,080 --> 06:01:22,718
keep him around though. The sustain here

9312
06:01:20,958 --> 06:01:23,280
for the Bros. is going to be a little

9313
06:01:22,718 --> 06:01:24,958
bit better.

9314
06:01:23,280 --> 06:01:26,558
Both top laners are backing looking to

9315
06:01:24,958 --> 06:01:29,760
TP in. This could be the fight that

9316
06:01:26,558 --> 06:01:31,440
decides to game. Yeah, Morgan very scary

9317
06:01:29,760 --> 06:01:32,480
on this crocodile as we know, but it

9318
06:01:31,440 --> 06:01:34,240
looks like

9319
06:01:32,480 --> 06:01:35,840
bro might be giving this up. Let's see

9320
06:01:34,240 --> 06:01:38,160
how this one's going to go. The teleport

9321
06:01:35,840 --> 06:01:39,360
comes in and Morgan with the rest of his

9322
06:01:38,160 --> 06:01:42,480
team and he's just walking forward. He's

9323
06:01:39,360 --> 06:01:43,840
like, "Guys, I am huge and I will be

9324
06:01:42,480 --> 06:01:45,280
able to take these guys down." Sponge

9325
06:01:43,840 --> 06:01:46,958
gets out of the pit. Crocco gets in.

9326
06:01:45,280 --> 06:01:48,958
There's the magnet storm and they've

9327
06:01:46,958 --> 06:01:50,400
caught two out of position. Down goes

9328
06:01:48,958 --> 06:01:52,320
the rise. Yeah, he didn't get the memo

9329
06:01:50,400 --> 06:01:54,320
that they were backing away and they

9330
06:01:52,320 --> 06:01:57,200
secure the dragon. The pros are looking

9331
06:01:54,320 --> 06:01:59,520
to try and do it again. That's speeds of

9332
06:01:57,200 --> 06:02:01,680
warfare as well locked down and they get

9333
06:01:59,520 --> 06:02:03,520
the second drake for themselves.

9334
06:02:01,680 --> 06:02:04,798
Might just be that might be looking for

9335
06:02:03,520 --> 06:02:07,120
as well.

9336
06:02:04,798 --> 06:02:08,798
Is this a bridge too far? The answer is

9337
06:02:07,120 --> 06:02:09,840
probably not because there's no rise for

9338
06:02:08,798 --> 06:02:12,400
another 20 seconds.

9339
06:02:09,840 --> 06:02:13,440
There's no Teddy. He's walking way over

9340
06:02:12,400 --> 06:02:14,000
from mid lane. I don't think they have

9341
06:02:13,440 --> 06:02:15,440
to damage.

9342
06:02:14,000 --> 06:02:17,680
Yeah, he doesn't have on the hunt

9343
06:02:15,440 --> 06:02:18,958
available as there's a little knock back

9344
06:02:17,680 --> 06:02:21,280
onto Morgan. They're going to look for

9345
06:02:18,958 --> 06:02:22,958
the turn angle. Cataclysm onto closer

9346
06:02:21,280 --> 06:02:24,878
who's standing his ground. Teddy gets

9347
06:02:22,958 --> 06:02:26,400
stunned up, but he's

9348
06:02:24,878 --> 06:02:28,000
doing a pretty good job standing his

9349
06:02:26,400 --> 06:02:29,600
ground. There's the dash around from the

9350
06:02:28,000 --> 06:02:32,558
Casante, but he just doesn't have any

9351
06:02:29,600 --> 06:02:34,958
money. Punch highway robbery as Polu

9352
06:02:32,558 --> 06:02:37,040
comes on over, but he's not able to stop

9353
06:02:34,958 --> 06:02:39,920
him. Teddy will go down as the slices

9354
06:02:37,040 --> 06:02:41,920
and dices come in, but is such a big

9355
06:02:39,920 --> 06:02:43,360
prize. And Yahoo, he's going to turn

9356
06:02:41,920 --> 06:02:46,160
back up. The triple knock up from

9357
06:02:43,360 --> 06:02:49,040
Sponge. They take down the Kaiser and

9358
06:02:46,160 --> 06:02:51,840
it's TRX that are able to get it done.

9359
06:02:49,040 --> 06:02:53,120
Morgan will go down and I have a feeling

9360
06:02:51,840 --> 06:02:55,760
that that emote is going to be

9361
06:02:53,120 --> 06:02:58,320
necessary. The shaky hands for the

9362
06:02:55,760 --> 06:03:00,400
Renekton out of frustration here for the

9363
06:02:58,320 --> 06:03:02,400
Bros unless they can get some sort of

9364
06:03:00,400 --> 06:03:05,280
psycho turn. I don't know about that one

9365
06:03:02,400 --> 06:03:07,680
as out goes Crocco and he's not even

9366
06:03:05,280 --> 06:03:09,520
able to get his raptors I don't think.

9367
06:03:07,680 --> 06:03:11,440
Man, it was so good when they took the

9368
06:03:09,520 --> 06:03:14,840
dragon and that was when we needed to

9369
06:03:11,440 --> 06:03:14,840
cut the video.

9370
06:03:16,638 --> 06:03:20,638
I'm a I'm a bit perplexed. I'm a bit at

9371
06:03:18,958 --> 06:03:22,638
a loss for words there Atlas because

9372
06:03:20,638 --> 06:03:24,480
that game should have been dunzo and I

9373
06:03:22,638 --> 06:03:26,878
want to highlight what happens here is

9374
06:03:24,480 --> 06:03:29,040
bro I think kind of get lost in the

9375
06:03:26,878 --> 06:03:32,400
sauce because what happens is we have a

9376
06:03:29,040 --> 06:03:33,360
complete turn if they just help closer

9377
06:03:32,400 --> 06:03:33,760
they win the fight.

9378
06:03:33,360 --> 06:03:36,878
Yeah.

9379
06:03:33,760 --> 06:03:39,440
If they just kill rich

9380
06:03:36,878 --> 06:03:43,360
immediately they win the fight. But the

9381
06:03:39,440 --> 06:03:45,840
fact that DRX get to keep the leash, get

9382
06:03:43,360 --> 06:03:47,760
the TP in,

9383
06:03:45,840 --> 06:03:49,680
get the autoacon as well as the fight

9384
06:03:47,760 --> 06:03:52,320
win might end up deciding the game. Now,

9385
06:03:49,680 --> 06:03:54,798
I want to make very clear that game is

9386
06:03:52,320 --> 06:03:56,878
not done. Uh, this was big for DRX, but

9387
06:03:54,798 --> 06:03:58,638
they were losing.

9388
06:03:56,878 --> 06:04:00,958
Gold lead, I think, is still about 1 and

9389
06:03:58,638 --> 06:04:03,680
a2k for bro.

9390
06:04:00,958 --> 06:04:06,638
Yeah. Yeah, something like that. Buton

9391
06:04:03,680 --> 06:04:08,718
is a lot, right? Is actually incredibly

9392
06:04:06,638 --> 06:04:09,760
high value. Basically, it's even is what

9393
06:04:08,718 --> 06:04:10,480
we're saying.

9394
06:04:09,760 --> 06:04:11,120
Um,

9395
06:04:10,480 --> 06:04:12,480
Poly died.

9396
06:04:11,120 --> 06:04:13,280
Poly died again.

9397
06:04:12,480 --> 06:04:14,240
Okay.

9398
06:04:13,280 --> 06:04:16,878
Not ideal.

9399
06:04:14,240 --> 06:04:18,798
Uh, Crocco is making rifts. He's looking

9400
06:04:16,878 --> 06:04:22,080
to make another summoner's rift.

9401
06:04:18,798 --> 06:04:24,878
Yahoo. Got another kill.

9402
06:04:22,080 --> 06:04:25,520
Yeah, he's five and one.

9403
06:04:24,878 --> 06:04:27,040
Yep.

9404
06:04:25,520 --> 06:04:28,000
That's a Wow,

9405
06:04:27,040 --> 06:04:30,000
it's a big rise.

9406
06:04:28,000 --> 06:04:32,160
Yeah. I also I just don't quite remember

9407
06:04:30,000 --> 06:04:33,760
when that happened.

9408
06:04:32,160 --> 06:04:34,878
Oh, he's been involved with six out of

9409
06:04:33,760 --> 06:04:36,878
the seven kills.

9410
06:04:34,878 --> 06:04:38,320
Yeah, he's having a great game.

9411
06:04:36,878 --> 06:04:39,520
as Oh, Apollo.

9412
06:04:38,320 --> 06:04:40,240
Oh dear.

9413
06:04:39,520 --> 06:04:42,798
Just um

9414
06:04:40,240 --> 06:04:44,400
very straightforward. Was caught in a

9415
06:04:42,798 --> 06:04:45,440
place on the map that he wasn't allowed

9416
06:04:44,400 --> 06:04:48,240
to be.

9417
06:04:45,440 --> 06:04:49,520
Just trying to clear vision as Morgan

9418
06:04:48,240 --> 06:04:51,120
might have to take matters into his own

9419
06:04:49,520 --> 06:04:51,840
hands. Can he get the plasma stack for

9420
06:04:51,120 --> 06:04:54,160
Hype?

9421
06:04:51,840 --> 06:04:55,600
Now he's going to try as Ridge goes all

9422
06:04:54,160 --> 06:04:58,000
out and then he's all out of options

9423
06:04:55,600 --> 06:04:59,200
unfortunately. And Hype comes on over.

9424
06:04:58,000 --> 06:05:01,280
That is going to be another one picked

9425
06:04:59,200 --> 06:05:05,440
up. He now has his Infinity Edge done.

9426
06:05:01,280 --> 06:05:07,680
So this Kaiser now able to fight on a

9427
06:05:05,440 --> 06:05:09,280
little bit more even footing. Teddy is

9428
06:05:07,680 --> 06:05:11,280
going to make it a little bit uneven

9429
06:05:09,280 --> 06:05:12,718
after he finishes his Infinity Edge, but

9430
06:05:11,280 --> 06:05:14,638
it's taking a little while.

9431
06:05:12,718 --> 06:05:15,680
And it is even a slight gold advantage

9432
06:05:14,638 --> 06:05:17,360
here for Hype as well.

9433
06:05:15,680 --> 06:05:20,080
Actually, we're in Rift Maker. Did

9434
06:05:17,360 --> 06:05:22,000
Krokco, so kind of cool.

9435
06:05:20,080 --> 06:05:23,040
It's a It's a build. He's building some

9436
06:05:22,000 --> 06:05:26,080
items,

9437
06:05:23,040 --> 06:05:28,240
making some stuff happen.

9438
06:05:26,080 --> 06:05:29,680
Curious as to what's happening next as

9439
06:05:28,240 --> 06:05:31,440
far as that build is concerned. Maybe it

9440
06:05:29,680 --> 06:05:32,958
is going to be Leandre's coming in

9441
06:05:31,440 --> 06:05:34,718
afterwards. Just pretend to be Rumble

9442
06:05:32,958 --> 06:05:36,240
after this.

9443
06:05:34,718 --> 06:05:38,480
Might be kind of the way to do it

9444
06:05:36,240 --> 06:05:41,600
at this point. Just go redemption, bro.

9445
06:05:38,480 --> 06:05:42,160
Just embrace the redemption Olaf energy.

9446
06:05:41,600 --> 06:05:43,680
Honestly,

9447
06:05:42,160 --> 06:05:45,680
you're going for like I'm not even

9448
06:05:43,680 --> 06:05:47,040
joking. Like redemption into the DRX

9449
06:05:45,680 --> 06:05:48,878
comp actually goes really hard.

9450
06:05:47,040 --> 06:05:50,958
Just rabbit on so that your your primal

9451
06:05:48,878 --> 06:05:52,798
surge just does so much more healing.

9452
06:05:50,958 --> 06:05:55,360
Yeah, but it's not team wipe, right?

9453
06:05:52,798 --> 06:05:57,360
No, it's not. It's nice. But maybe you

9454
06:05:55,360 --> 06:05:59,920
don't need your team to live. You just

9455
06:05:57,360 --> 06:06:02,400
need Morgan. Well, I would say you just

9456
06:05:59,920 --> 06:06:04,638
need hype actually. Um, but I do like

9457
06:06:02,400 --> 06:06:06,638
your Morgan propaganda.

9458
06:06:04,638 --> 06:06:09,440
No, I am uh I'm committed.

9459
06:06:06,638 --> 06:06:11,120
You are. So,

9460
06:06:09,440 --> 06:06:14,400
the game is basically even, especially

9461
06:06:11,120 --> 06:06:16,400
taking the two pound upper dragon. I

9462
06:06:14,400 --> 06:06:18,080
think the RX have a slight scaling

9463
06:06:16,400 --> 06:06:19,680
advantage, but that does really fall

9464
06:06:18,080 --> 06:06:22,400
apart if like Teddy is ever out of

9465
06:06:19,680 --> 06:06:24,160
position, right? Cuz then

9466
06:06:22,400 --> 06:06:26,718
ignore that minus one cuz it was Morgan,

9467
06:06:24,160 --> 06:06:28,240
so it doesn't count. He didn't need that

9468
06:06:26,718 --> 06:06:29,760
money.

9469
06:06:28,240 --> 06:06:31,200
Dad, are you familiar with the term

9470
06:06:29,760 --> 06:06:32,000
biased cost?

9471
06:06:31,200 --> 06:06:33,200
Yes.

9472
06:06:32,000 --> 06:06:34,400
Yes. Are you sure?

9473
06:06:33,200 --> 06:06:36,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Because I'm

9474
06:06:34,400 --> 06:06:38,160
biased towards Morgan.

9475
06:06:36,480 --> 06:06:38,638
Okay. Just making sure. Yeah. Well, that

9476
06:06:38,160 --> 06:06:39,920
was that was

9477
06:06:38,638 --> 06:06:41,440
I think it's I think it's different when

9478
06:06:39,920 --> 06:06:42,718
you're biased towards a player rather

9479
06:06:41,440 --> 06:06:44,558
than a team.

9480
06:06:42,718 --> 06:06:46,000
Well, it's also again I've said this

9481
06:06:44,558 --> 06:06:48,480
many times, but we're never called out

9482
06:06:46,000 --> 06:06:50,718
for bias. So, I think you're also easy.

9483
06:06:48,480 --> 06:06:51,200
I think you're also allowed like two,

9484
06:06:50,718 --> 06:06:52,798
right?

9485
06:06:51,200 --> 06:06:53,680
So, because it's barrel and Morgan.

9486
06:06:52,798 --> 06:06:55,280
Yeah.

9487
06:06:53,680 --> 06:06:56,000
And death. But that is, you know,

9488
06:06:55,280 --> 06:06:58,240
retired, right?

9489
06:06:56,000 --> 06:06:59,600
Yeah. Yeah. He's in military at the

9490
06:06:58,240 --> 06:07:02,878
moment.

9491
06:06:59,600 --> 06:07:05,200
I don't mind. Lucid Crocco. Oh, I guess

9492
06:07:02,878 --> 06:07:06,878
you did sort of forfeit your time. Oh,

9493
06:07:05,200 --> 06:07:08,958
flag and drag into the realm war. That's

9494
06:07:06,878 --> 06:07:10,638
pretty cute. As DRX just going to look

9495
06:07:08,958 --> 06:07:11,600
for a little bit of a baron steel.

9496
06:07:10,638 --> 06:07:13,040
I think it's gone.

9497
06:07:11,600 --> 06:07:14,240
I think the Bros know that this is

9498
06:07:13,040 --> 06:07:15,520
happening, but can they actually do

9499
06:07:14,240 --> 06:07:16,240
anything about it? That's the question.

9500
06:07:15,520 --> 06:07:17,920
Too late.

9501
06:07:16,240 --> 06:07:19,840
Yeah, probably going to get held out of

9502
06:07:17,920 --> 06:07:21,920
the pit here as Andrew just buying space

9503
06:07:19,840 --> 06:07:23,600
and the spear is not going to land

9504
06:07:21,920 --> 06:07:26,400
highway robbery. They'll be able to

9505
06:07:23,600 --> 06:07:28,798
steal away the purple buff.

9506
06:07:26,400 --> 06:07:30,958
That's the rise value. There it is

9507
06:07:28,798 --> 06:07:32,958
right there. And that's why you can't

9508
06:07:30,958 --> 06:07:33,840
give up vision control around that area

9509
06:07:32,958 --> 06:07:35,840
even for a moment.

9510
06:07:33,840 --> 06:07:38,718
Well, they knew, right? And actually

9511
06:07:35,840 --> 06:07:40,240
think Kroco could have made it. Just

9512
06:07:38,718 --> 06:07:42,480
didn't have the time. They're going to

9513
06:07:40,240 --> 06:07:45,120
get soul point, but soul point for Nash.

9514
06:07:42,480 --> 06:07:48,000
That's not worth it. Soul nob brainer.

9515
06:07:45,120 --> 06:07:49,200
Now they got to hold on tight and pray

9516
06:07:48,000 --> 06:07:51,280
that they get the opportunity to get

9517
06:07:49,200 --> 06:07:52,718
themselves to chem to the hex soul

9518
06:07:51,280 --> 06:07:54,320
somehow.

9519
06:07:52,718 --> 06:07:55,920
It's going to be the big one, but Sponge

9520
06:07:54,320 --> 06:07:57,520
and Yahoo getting to work on this inner

9521
06:07:55,920 --> 06:08:00,000
turret. That is going to extend the gold

9522
06:07:57,520 --> 06:08:04,240
lead here for DRX as they move to about

9523
06:08:00,000 --> 06:08:05,840
Yeah. 3k Rebel Baron power play here.

9524
06:08:04,240 --> 06:08:08,160
And Crocco possibly caught out of

9525
06:08:05,840 --> 06:08:10,718
position unless it's a cunning ruse.

9526
06:08:08,160 --> 06:08:12,240
Rich making his way over Hype. We know

9527
06:08:10,718 --> 06:08:13,600
that he's in danger. Does he know?

9528
06:08:12,240 --> 06:08:15,680
That's the real question as there's

9529
06:08:13,600 --> 06:08:17,280
Yahoo flashing on top. The flash out

9530
06:08:15,680 --> 06:08:18,558
immediately there from Hype as well.

9531
06:08:17,280 --> 06:08:21,520
Shattering Strike. Not something that

9532
06:08:18,558 --> 06:08:23,600
Rich really cares about as TRX keep all

9533
06:08:21,520 --> 06:08:24,000
these Barons alive. Look for a bit of a

9534
06:08:23,600 --> 06:08:25,360
reset.

9535
06:08:24,000 --> 06:08:26,400
I know what the other one was. It was

9536
06:08:25,360 --> 06:08:27,280
pace.

9537
06:08:26,400 --> 06:08:29,840
Ah, there it is.

9538
06:08:27,280 --> 06:08:31,360
Yeah, there you go. Easy.

9539
06:08:29,840 --> 06:08:32,878
Well,

9540
06:08:31,360 --> 06:08:34,080
I actually have a lot now that I think

9541
06:08:32,878 --> 06:08:36,240
about it.

9542
06:08:34,080 --> 06:08:38,240
Yeah, there's a few.

9543
06:08:36,240 --> 06:08:39,840
And I'm sure it's not just Morgan and

9544
06:08:38,240 --> 06:08:42,558
Barrel for me as well

9545
06:08:39,840 --> 06:08:45,120
as Yahoo as you highlight picks up the

9546
06:08:42,558 --> 06:08:48,160
Rabidons was already a complete menace.

9547
06:08:45,120 --> 06:08:50,000
Machine gunning down everyone in his uh

9548
06:08:48,160 --> 06:08:51,520
in his sight.

9549
06:08:50,000 --> 06:08:52,320
Morgan should be finishing his third

9550
06:08:51,520 --> 06:08:54,240
item.

9551
06:08:52,320 --> 06:08:57,760
This is a huge swing though. The gold

9552
06:08:54,240 --> 06:09:00,958
was pretty firmly in Bro's favor.

9553
06:08:57,760 --> 06:09:03,360
That said, Bro can actually just sit and

9554
06:09:00,958 --> 06:09:05,120
not do anything for the next like 8 and

9555
06:09:03,360 --> 06:09:07,040
1/2 minutes.

9556
06:09:05,120 --> 06:09:09,120
They can, right? Because they they're

9557
06:09:07,040 --> 06:09:10,240
sitting at top point. DRX is nowhere

9558
06:09:09,120 --> 06:09:12,080
near.

9559
06:09:10,240 --> 06:09:14,080
The the real issue again is what do you

9560
06:09:12,080 --> 06:09:16,718
actually scale towards

9561
06:09:14,080 --> 06:09:18,320
and it really is just Casio and Hype.

9562
06:09:16,718 --> 06:09:19,680
It's a bit cute. On the hunt does come

9563
06:09:18,320 --> 06:09:20,638
down. That's a good charm on a closer.

9564
06:09:19,680 --> 06:09:22,320
But they don't really get any real

9565
06:09:20,638 --> 06:09:24,400
damage on the hunt now on cool down. In

9566
06:09:22,320 --> 06:09:25,760
fact, both bottom laners using their

9567
06:09:24,400 --> 06:09:28,878
buttons.

9568
06:09:25,760 --> 06:09:30,240
Oh god. Okay. Both top laners going to

9569
06:09:28,878 --> 06:09:32,480
join the backside of this fight as

9570
06:09:30,240 --> 06:09:35,120
Morgan. He wants out. He's got splicing.

9571
06:09:32,480 --> 06:09:36,400
He's dying and he's uh he's Yeah, he's

9572
06:09:35,120 --> 06:09:37,600
just he's just getting out of the way.

9573
06:09:36,400 --> 06:09:40,480
Man, I thought that was going to be so

9574
06:09:37,600 --> 06:09:42,080
much more exciting and cool than it was.

9575
06:09:40,480 --> 06:09:43,040
That's okay. It's a tense situation

9576
06:09:42,080 --> 06:09:44,958
here.

9577
06:09:43,040 --> 06:09:47,680
There is no objective. These teams are

9578
06:09:44,958 --> 06:09:49,200
just But obviously DX trying to get out

9579
06:09:47,680 --> 06:09:50,400
of the Rebel Baron power play which was

9580
06:09:49,200 --> 06:09:51,840
fine sponge.

9581
06:09:50,400 --> 06:09:53,520
Yeah, doesn't quite find the flag and

9582
06:09:51,840 --> 06:09:56,080
drag there as Kro is able to pounce his

9583
06:09:53,520 --> 06:09:58,080
way out. Yahoo is so scary though. They

9584
06:09:56,080 --> 06:10:00,480
do back out of the way of this rise.

9585
06:09:58,080 --> 06:10:03,360
Even the ricochets, man. Oh, Teddy is

9586
06:10:00,480 --> 06:10:06,558
really starting to hurt

9587
06:10:03,360 --> 06:10:08,080
and late game is where this man thrives.

9588
06:10:06,558 --> 06:10:09,840
You can see the nerves. They know how

9589
06:10:08,080 --> 06:10:12,558
important this match is really big deal.

9590
06:10:09,840 --> 06:10:15,440
When a highlight again, bottom two are

9591
06:10:12,558 --> 06:10:18,160
out. DNF, they're not technically locked

9592
06:10:15,440 --> 06:10:20,240
yet, but they are in obviously a very

9593
06:10:18,160 --> 06:10:21,920
deep hole right now, but it's probably

9594
06:10:20,240 --> 06:10:23,200
going to be one of these two teams in

9595
06:10:21,920 --> 06:10:27,520
ninth place. Yeah,

9596
06:10:23,200 --> 06:10:29,200
it's them or BNK most likely. So getting

9597
06:10:27,520 --> 06:10:32,000
a direct win over your opponents is a

9598
06:10:29,200 --> 06:10:33,920
really big deal. And for Bion

9599
06:10:32,000 --> 06:10:36,480
really their a lot of their wins funnily

9600
06:10:33,920 --> 06:10:37,520
enough came against teams on the other

9601
06:10:36,480 --> 06:10:40,000
side.

9602
06:10:37,520 --> 06:10:41,840
Legend group not against their direct

9603
06:10:40,000 --> 06:10:44,878
compatriots

9604
06:10:41,840 --> 06:10:46,080
here in the rise group for DRX. What a

9605
06:10:44,878 --> 06:10:47,680
big one it would be. Means that they

9606
06:10:46,080 --> 06:10:48,958
equalize the score.

9607
06:10:47,680 --> 06:10:50,878
This is kind of crazy though cuz the

9608
06:10:48,958 --> 06:10:52,558
Baron has now worn off. Yes, they

9609
06:10:50,878 --> 06:10:54,718
eliminated all the inner turrets. They

9610
06:10:52,558 --> 06:10:56,718
got themselves a decent gold lead, but

9611
06:10:54,718 --> 06:10:57,280
it's only decent. It's only 3k.

9612
06:10:56,718 --> 06:10:59,200
Yep.

9613
06:10:57,280 --> 06:11:00,718
We have another fight that's going to

9614
06:10:59,200 --> 06:11:04,718
happen in a minute and a half

9615
06:11:00,718 --> 06:11:06,558
approximately on this Hexte dragon

9616
06:11:04,718 --> 06:11:08,320
and it's going to lead directly into a

9617
06:11:06,558 --> 06:11:09,920
Baron immediately afterwards. It depends

9618
06:11:08,320 --> 06:11:11,280
how much milling about we're going to do

9619
06:11:09,920 --> 06:11:14,240
to see whether both of these objectives

9620
06:11:11,280 --> 06:11:16,798
are up at the same time or not.

9621
06:11:14,240 --> 06:11:20,240
But man, this has gotten very tense,

9622
06:11:16,798 --> 06:11:22,638
very very close when it did feel at

9623
06:11:20,240 --> 06:11:24,400
different separate moments each team

9624
06:11:22,638 --> 06:11:28,080
would run away with it. felt like that

9625
06:11:24,400 --> 06:11:29,920
Baron play was a huge back breaker. It

9626
06:11:28,080 --> 06:11:31,200
turns out, you know, Bro were able to

9627
06:11:29,920 --> 06:11:33,360
weather the storm. They didn't throw

9628
06:11:31,200 --> 06:11:35,520
away anymore. The main thing is the map

9629
06:11:33,360 --> 06:11:37,520
control cuz once you have that Baron

9630
06:11:35,520 --> 06:11:39,200
containing or keeping map control is a

9631
06:11:37,520 --> 06:11:40,558
lot easier as we can see here,

9632
06:11:39,200 --> 06:11:42,240
right? Broer still hasn't really been

9633
06:11:40,558 --> 06:11:44,320
able to fully retake.

9634
06:11:42,240 --> 06:11:45,920
There's also this rise problem.

9635
06:11:44,320 --> 06:11:47,280
Yeah. Well, I mean, Yo has been a

9636
06:11:45,920 --> 06:11:50,638
problem the entire game, right? Like the

9637
06:11:47,280 --> 06:11:52,240
lead is getting kind of ridiculous. Um,

9638
06:11:50,638 --> 06:11:54,480
but what I want to really highlight is

9639
06:11:52,240 --> 06:11:56,080
that because of this, I think bro just

9640
06:11:54,480 --> 06:11:57,760
gives this next drake. I actually don't

9641
06:11:56,080 --> 06:11:59,280
think you can test cuz I think that if

9642
06:11:57,760 --> 06:12:02,160
you don't, you're going to be able to

9643
06:11:59,280 --> 06:12:05,440
get to a fourmon hype to a four item on

9644
06:12:02,160 --> 06:12:06,958
closer and those are big break points.

9645
06:12:05,440 --> 06:12:08,958
Getting void staff I think is a big

9646
06:12:06,958 --> 06:12:11,840
deal. Obviously for your Renekton, for

9647
06:12:08,958 --> 06:12:13,840
your Ni, it doesn't feel that great, but

9648
06:12:11,840 --> 06:12:16,480
if you lose the game or if you flip the

9649
06:12:13,840 --> 06:12:20,480
game here and you don't get the dragon

9650
06:12:16,480 --> 06:12:22,718
might just be the end of it. And for

9651
06:12:20,480 --> 06:12:24,240
Bro, I think the target selection is a

9652
06:12:22,718 --> 06:12:25,920
lot harder. They need to somehow find a

9653
06:12:24,240 --> 06:12:27,360
flank with Morgan. If he can't get into

9654
06:12:25,920 --> 06:12:28,638
the enemy backline, I don't think he can

9655
06:12:27,360 --> 06:12:31,760
win the fight.

9656
06:12:28,638 --> 06:12:33,760
And it's so frustrating as well because

9657
06:12:31,760 --> 06:12:35,760
they need to kill both Yahoo and Teddy

9658
06:12:33,760 --> 06:12:37,360
immediately at the very beginning of the

9659
06:12:35,760 --> 06:12:40,240
fight.

9660
06:12:37,360 --> 06:12:42,080
Spell shield going to get popped here.

9661
06:12:40,240 --> 06:12:43,920
But the bros, they are looking for it.

9662
06:12:42,080 --> 06:12:47,680
They want to fight for this. 5 seconds.

9663
06:12:43,920 --> 06:12:50,400
And Crocco getting dove on here by Ando.

9664
06:12:47,680 --> 06:12:52,558
The dragon has now spawned. Oh goodness.

9665
06:12:50,400 --> 06:12:55,280
Are we flipping for Hexte soul?

9666
06:12:52,558 --> 06:12:56,480
Oh yeah, bro. Want to for sure. Well,

9667
06:12:55,280 --> 06:12:58,400
they're going to start this one up. Oh

9668
06:12:56,480 --> 06:12:59,840
my goodness. Taking so much damage.

9669
06:12:58,400 --> 06:13:01,440
Morgan is just going to be Hex getting

9670
06:12:59,840 --> 06:13:03,040
Nova. Rich will follow him. But

9671
06:13:01,440 --> 06:13:05,280
Quickness gets into the backline. But

9672
06:13:03,040 --> 06:13:08,480
where is the follow up as Morgan flashes

9673
06:13:05,280 --> 06:13:10,480
over and Rich uses it as a way to taxi

9674
06:13:08,480 --> 06:13:12,878
his way forward. They take down the

9675
06:13:10,480 --> 06:13:14,160
Javan. The killer instinct. Oh no, he

9676
06:13:12,878 --> 06:13:15,680
didn't really want to do that. But

9677
06:13:14,160 --> 06:13:17,440
fortunately, they did have a crocodile,

9678
06:13:15,680 --> 06:13:20,080
but it may not be enough. Closer is

9679
06:13:17,440 --> 06:13:22,638
still alive. Yahoo is so big. And in

9680
06:13:20,080 --> 06:13:24,718
goes Crocco. And I just don't think

9681
06:13:22,638 --> 06:13:27,680
he'll have any assistance here. And

9682
06:13:24,718 --> 06:13:29,680
Yahoo has to do it alone. He has to be

9683
06:13:27,680 --> 06:13:32,878
the hero, but he's on the Myasma. And

9684
06:13:29,680 --> 06:13:36,400
he's taken by Crocco. And they have the

9685
06:13:32,878 --> 06:13:38,320
hex tech soul.

9686
06:13:36,400 --> 06:13:42,878
I didn't even see the dragon go down.

9687
06:13:38,320 --> 06:13:45,600
This is absolute cinema and I love it.

9688
06:13:42,878 --> 06:13:47,760
Mayhem Atlas.

9689
06:13:45,600 --> 06:13:49,360
I I I I I don't even know what happened.

9690
06:13:47,760 --> 06:13:51,440
I We're going to try and do our best.

9691
06:13:49,360 --> 06:13:53,440
Look at Morgan, man. He's like, I've

9692
06:13:51,440 --> 06:13:55,280
been run prisoned. Teddy doesn't have

9693
06:13:53,440 --> 06:13:57,120
spell shield.

9694
06:13:55,280 --> 06:13:59,680
Takes care of two people. Crocco is just

9695
06:13:57,120 --> 06:14:02,638
ensuring they get the smite. Gets it at

9696
06:13:59,680 --> 06:14:04,638
111. And even if this fight doesn't go

9697
06:14:02,638 --> 06:14:06,958
their way, just that I think was enough

9698
06:14:04,638 --> 06:14:09,200
as long as they don't decisively lose it

9699
06:14:06,958 --> 06:14:10,718
to be a win, right? Cuz Hexo I think is

9700
06:14:09,200 --> 06:14:13,280
the most broken sword in the game. But

9701
06:14:10,718 --> 06:14:15,440
then here the heal value is actually

9702
06:14:13,280 --> 06:14:17,440
crazy. Therefore, Crocco

9703
06:14:15,440 --> 06:14:19,760
Yeah. Croc like Closer had a pocket

9704
06:14:17,440 --> 06:14:21,200
healer. It was like watching like WoW

9705
06:14:19,760 --> 06:14:23,600
arena,

9706
06:14:21,200 --> 06:14:25,040
you know, and they just didn't kill.

9707
06:14:23,600 --> 06:14:26,798
He was wobbing and weaving. He was

9708
06:14:25,040 --> 06:14:30,798
getting that line of sight. And in the

9709
06:14:26,798 --> 06:14:32,958
meantime, Sponge is just dead.

9710
06:14:30,798 --> 06:14:34,958
Okay, welcome back to live, ladies and

9711
06:14:32,958 --> 06:14:37,200
gentlemen. The jungler is now down and

9712
06:14:34,958 --> 06:14:39,280
the bros

9713
06:14:37,200 --> 06:14:42,000
Oh, there must have been an influx. It

9714
06:14:39,280 --> 06:14:45,120
must have been you guys yet again. The

9715
06:14:42,000 --> 06:14:48,400
purple in the chat has now transferred

9716
06:14:45,120 --> 06:14:50,240
into the game and is now a buff

9717
06:14:48,400 --> 06:14:51,520
surrounding the bros as they march

9718
06:14:50,240 --> 06:14:53,280
towards DRX.

9719
06:14:51,520 --> 06:14:55,760
Pay to win in my LCK.

9720
06:14:53,280 --> 06:14:58,718
Oh, absolutely. And we love to see it.

9721
06:14:55,760 --> 06:15:01,360
Capitalism, baby. As All right, the Bros

9722
06:14:58,718 --> 06:15:04,160
now just diving. They know they can see

9723
06:15:01,360 --> 06:15:07,200
it. And they've got hex tech. It is so

9724
06:15:04,160 --> 06:15:09,440
disgusting. Down goes everything. Hype

9725
06:15:07,200 --> 06:15:12,240
is collecting a triple kill. And Teddy

9726
06:15:09,440 --> 06:15:14,798
turns up just like Donald Glover with

9727
06:15:12,240 --> 06:15:16,958
the pizza. It's a quadra under the

9728
06:15:14,798 --> 06:15:18,638
inhibitor turret. Inhibitor to follow

9729
06:15:16,958 --> 06:15:21,440
here. And the bros, they are done with

9730
06:15:18,638 --> 06:15:25,840
this. They want to go home.

9731
06:15:21,440 --> 06:15:27,600
It's about 11 p.m. and yeah, out of the

9732
06:15:25,840 --> 06:15:28,958
death chamber and straight back in there

9733
06:15:27,600 --> 06:15:31,120
once again. Could have potentially been

9734
06:15:28,958 --> 06:15:32,558
a pentacill there for hype, but instead

9735
06:15:31,120 --> 06:15:34,798
it's Crocker that locks it down and the

9736
06:15:32,558 --> 06:15:37,680
Bros do it again. Backto back reverse

9737
06:15:34,798 --> 06:15:42,160
sweeps here in their first week of this

9738
06:15:37,680 --> 06:15:44,080
round. They're looking good.

9739
06:15:42,160 --> 06:15:47,120
Lot of excitement,

9740
06:15:44,080 --> 06:15:50,558
a lot of hype

9741
06:15:47,120 --> 06:15:53,120
performances from hype as well on this

9742
06:15:50,558 --> 06:15:54,958
Kai'Sa. Not the easiest pick to execute,

9743
06:15:53,120 --> 06:15:57,440
but I'm looking at that mid jungle duo

9744
06:15:54,958 --> 06:16:00,160
again. I'm looking at in the previous

9745
06:15:57,440 --> 06:16:03,360
game. It was for me mostly closer on

9746
06:16:00,160 --> 06:16:04,958
that. In this game, I think Crocco

9747
06:16:03,360 --> 06:16:08,000
actually made the Ni work. I think he

9748
06:16:04,958 --> 06:16:10,240
keeps his pass. There was a crocodile.

9749
06:16:08,000 --> 06:16:10,958
I think it was a weird game as well.

9750
06:16:10,240 --> 06:16:12,638
It was. Yeah,

9751
06:16:10,958 --> 06:16:14,958
it was. There wasn't a lot of spears

9752
06:16:12,638 --> 06:16:16,638
landing, but the way that he got around

9753
06:16:14,958 --> 06:16:18,400
team fights, especially later in the

9754
06:16:16,638 --> 06:16:20,080
game, he was useful.

9755
06:16:18,400 --> 06:16:21,200
And uh that's not something a lot of

9756
06:16:20,080 --> 06:16:23,760
nitalies can say.

9757
06:16:21,200 --> 06:16:24,878
And then um as highlighted,

9758
06:16:23,760 --> 06:16:25,520
uh Morgan,

9759
06:16:24,878 --> 06:16:27,200
oh yeah,

9760
06:16:25,520 --> 06:16:28,718
flawless performance here on the

9761
06:16:27,200 --> 06:16:30,320
connection. I think he did have a bit of

9762
06:16:28,718 --> 06:16:30,718
more of an up and down in the series as

9763
06:16:30,320 --> 06:16:32,400
a whole.

9764
06:16:30,718 --> 06:16:33,360
I think his scion was also robbed of a

9765
06:16:32,400 --> 06:16:38,080
victory there in that game.

9766
06:16:33,360 --> 06:16:40,160
Uh I don't think his I think his

9767
06:16:38,080 --> 06:16:41,920
pretty flawless. It was not great. His

9768
06:16:40,160 --> 06:16:43,440
son wasn't He got a lot of value out of

9769
06:16:41,920 --> 06:16:44,400
the zombie. Not a lot of people get a

9770
06:16:43,440 --> 06:16:46,080
lot of value out of the zombie.

9771
06:16:44,400 --> 06:16:46,878
It really He didn't hit it all, Atlas.

9772
06:16:46,080 --> 06:16:48,798
It was It was rough.

9773
06:16:46,878 --> 06:16:50,480
He did hit one fourman after everyone

9774
06:16:48,798 --> 06:16:52,400
else on his team. How did he

9775
06:16:50,480 --> 06:16:54,798
He also hit He did the one where he went

9776
06:16:52,400 --> 06:16:56,160
into the turret and his charge

9777
06:16:54,798 --> 06:16:58,000
explosion.

9778
06:16:56,160 --> 06:16:59,440
Yeah. So, the entertainment value is

9779
06:16:58,000 --> 06:16:59,840
extraordinarily high out of his side,

9780
06:16:59,440 --> 06:17:02,320
let's say.

9781
06:16:59,840 --> 06:17:03,920
Yeah. And uh

9782
06:17:02,320 --> 06:17:06,080
on this on the flip side, a bit of a

9783
06:17:03,920 --> 06:17:09,840
heartbreaker for DRX. They got very

9784
06:17:06,080 --> 06:17:10,958
close. Yahoo actually having a monstrous

9785
06:17:09,840 --> 06:17:11,680
performance on the rise.

9786
06:17:10,958 --> 06:17:13,760
Oh yeah,

9787
06:17:11,680 --> 06:17:16,080
but the timing wasn't quite there. And I

9788
06:17:13,760 --> 06:17:19,360
think when you look at team fighting,

9789
06:17:16,080 --> 06:17:21,200
it has to be the Jarvin, it has to be

9790
06:17:19,360 --> 06:17:23,360
the Casante, and it has to be the

9791
06:17:21,200 --> 06:17:25,120
Raakan, right? And those three need to

9792
06:17:23,360 --> 06:17:27,440
work in cohesion. And I think early on

9793
06:17:25,120 --> 06:17:29,280
we saw it, but as the game progressed,

9794
06:17:27,440 --> 06:17:31,120
we kind of lost that.

9795
06:17:29,280 --> 06:17:32,958
And the thing that's really hard as well

9796
06:17:31,120 --> 06:17:35,440
is that it was a bit of a top gap

9797
06:17:32,958 --> 06:17:36,718
situation, right? A bit. and uh

9798
06:17:35,440 --> 06:17:39,040
zero and six.

9799
06:17:36,718 --> 06:17:41,280
This is also and I want to step away

9800
06:17:39,040 --> 06:17:44,558
from my you know overblown Morgan

9801
06:17:41,280 --> 06:17:46,320
fandom. He is not the best top laner in

9802
06:17:44,558 --> 06:17:47,920
the league

9803
06:17:46,320 --> 06:17:50,878
that crocodile.

9804
06:17:47,920 --> 06:17:52,480
He is on his croc his atrox also um had

9805
06:17:50,878 --> 06:17:55,520
a pretty game-winning flank towards the

9806
06:17:52,480 --> 06:17:57,680
end of that second game as well. But I

9807
06:17:55,520 --> 06:17:58,160
mean Rich just got absolutely bodied in

9808
06:17:57,680 --> 06:18:00,480
this game.

9809
06:17:58,160 --> 06:18:03,280
He did.

9810
06:18:00,480 --> 06:18:04,958
We'll see. I think PM I think uh anyone

9811
06:18:03,280 --> 06:18:07,040
on the top side really makes sense. I

9812
06:18:04,958 --> 06:18:09,280
think Morgan given his uh as you

9813
06:18:07,040 --> 06:18:11,440
highlight I think his particularly his

9814
06:18:09,280 --> 06:18:14,160
Renekton performance but even the flank

9815
06:18:11,440 --> 06:18:15,520
on the Hox was nice uh closer is a

9816
06:18:14,160 --> 06:18:16,718
no-brainer. I think this game he really

9817
06:18:15,520 --> 06:18:18,080
struggled, but I think in the other two

9818
06:18:16,718 --> 06:18:19,840
games he was really good. And then

9819
06:18:18,080 --> 06:18:21,360
Crocco for me consistently over the

9820
06:18:19,840 --> 06:18:23,280
series. I think just did a great job

9821
06:18:21,360 --> 06:18:24,400
with his early impact.

9822
06:18:23,280 --> 06:18:26,558
And a weird

9823
06:18:24,400 --> 06:18:28,718
I still have no idea what happened there

9824
06:18:26,558 --> 06:18:30,798
with Sponge

9825
06:18:28,718 --> 06:18:31,280
and maybe he thought they were on the

9826
06:18:30,798 --> 06:18:32,798
Baron.

9827
06:18:31,280 --> 06:18:34,160
Yeah, of course they didn't vision,

9828
06:18:32,798 --> 06:18:35,520
right? So he needs to check for Baron.

9829
06:18:34,160 --> 06:18:37,760
So he just at that point the game is

9830
06:18:35,520 --> 06:18:40,638
lost. So it doesn't they lost Hex Soul.

9831
06:18:37,760 --> 06:18:43,920
So it was just kind of over already.

9832
06:18:40,638 --> 06:18:47,120
Man, what an incredible journey we went

9833
06:18:43,920 --> 06:18:49,600
on tonight though in this series. Even

9834
06:18:47,120 --> 06:18:53,920
in our first series, right, Genji losing

9835
06:18:49,600 --> 06:18:56,558
their first series after 27 in a row.

9836
06:18:53,920 --> 06:18:59,360
And then we got this. The bros showing

9837
06:18:56,558 --> 06:19:02,638
that they have more tenacity

9838
06:18:59,360 --> 06:19:05,280
than someone that built merc treads and

9839
06:19:02,638 --> 06:19:08,480
and and and got feeds and strengths

9840
06:19:05,280 --> 06:19:10,878
and got sterox and all sorts and got

9841
06:19:08,480 --> 06:19:12,400
zephr from a patch long ago.

9842
06:19:10,878 --> 06:19:14,878
Look at look at the vibes.

9843
06:19:12,400 --> 06:19:16,480
Yeah, man. It's beautiful. Look at that.

9844
06:19:14,878 --> 06:19:18,638
The bro cliff.

9845
06:19:16,480 --> 06:19:20,878
They showed them the island and then

9846
06:19:18,638 --> 06:19:21,280
they threw them off and they drowned in

9847
06:19:20,878 --> 06:19:22,878
the

9848
06:19:21,280 --> 06:19:24,718
trench right there out there. It really

9849
06:19:22,878 --> 06:19:26,480
is. Really is. You got to be careful of

9850
06:19:24,718 --> 06:19:26,958
tsunamis with a with a with a trench

9851
06:19:26,480 --> 06:19:28,878
like that.

9852
06:19:26,958 --> 06:19:29,840
Yeah. This final game at closer. Not not

9853
06:19:28,878 --> 06:19:30,240
the

9854
06:19:29,840 --> 06:19:34,320
Yeah,

9855
06:19:30,240 --> 06:19:36,080
the best cas I don't think p was a was a

9856
06:19:34,320 --> 06:19:38,558
was a tick in the mid box.

9857
06:19:36,080 --> 06:19:41,280
No, I did not go for that.

9858
06:19:38,558 --> 06:19:43,440
This one pretty intelligent. 301

9859
06:19:41,280 --> 06:19:46,080
actually on the niti towards the end. I

9860
06:19:43,440 --> 06:19:48,320
think that the vi target selection saved

9861
06:19:46,080 --> 06:19:50,080
them the game in game number two.

9862
06:19:48,320 --> 06:19:52,878
Well, you you come on. We talked about

9863
06:19:50,080 --> 06:19:53,760
B. You know why he went for?

9864
06:19:52,878 --> 06:19:54,718
It was Morgan, right?

9865
06:19:53,760 --> 06:19:55,360
It was Crocco.

9866
06:19:54,718 --> 06:19:55,680
Oh, right.

9867
06:19:55,360 --> 06:19:57,760
Yeah.

9868
06:19:55,680 --> 06:19:59,120
Oh, you you almost you you almost got me

9869
06:19:57,760 --> 06:20:01,360
there. I thought maybe you you'd done

9870
06:19:59,120 --> 06:20:04,160
the right vote, but

9871
06:20:01,360 --> 06:20:06,400
I had to be serious that you know

9872
06:20:04,160 --> 06:20:08,878
Crocco's he's a good player, but it's

9873
06:20:06,400 --> 06:20:09,600
just no Morgan. The Morgan's flanks on

9874
06:20:08,878 --> 06:20:11,920
the the

9875
06:20:09,600 --> 06:20:13,440
Isn't it nice that in the past when we

9876
06:20:11,920 --> 06:20:14,958
casted we would have to have these

9877
06:20:13,440 --> 06:20:16,080
players on opposite sides and now we

9878
06:20:14,958 --> 06:20:17,760
just both get to enjoy.

9879
06:20:16,080 --> 06:20:20,320
I know. It's pretty good. It's like it's

9880
06:20:17,760 --> 06:20:22,958
kind of just like Sandbox and Bro got

9881
06:20:20,320 --> 06:20:25,440
smooshed together, which as our known

9882
06:20:22,958 --> 06:20:27,600
bro antie here at the LCK

9883
06:20:25,440 --> 06:20:31,040
is really difficult. So now with the

9884
06:20:27,600 --> 06:20:34,160
fact that DGO skipped a bro day to go

9885
06:20:31,040 --> 06:20:35,520
and support, you know, to go to the T1.

9886
06:20:34,160 --> 06:20:36,240
Don't put that pressure. Don't put that

9887
06:20:35,520 --> 06:20:38,480
pressure on me.

9888
06:20:36,240 --> 06:20:41,200
So now like we need someone to be the

9889
06:20:38,480 --> 06:20:42,958
bro fan because Don's gone.

9890
06:20:41,200 --> 06:20:47,440
It's not me.

9891
06:20:42,958 --> 06:20:49,440
It's Crocco. Well, I

9892
06:20:47,440 --> 06:20:51,920
I am still president of the Crocco fan

9893
06:20:49,440 --> 06:20:52,878
club and that will remain the case.

9894
06:20:51,920 --> 06:20:54,400
Not going anywhere.

9895
06:20:52,878 --> 06:20:57,440
Mhm.

9896
06:20:54,400 --> 06:20:59,360
But Crocco, it's not the Broco fan club.

9897
06:20:57,440 --> 06:21:00,400
Okay. Crocco

9898
06:20:59,360 --> 06:21:02,718
specifically.

9899
06:21:00,400 --> 06:21:03,920
I think the Broco fan club actually has

9900
06:21:02,718 --> 06:21:05,440
a really nice ring.

9901
06:21:03,920 --> 06:21:05,840
That actually sounds amazing, doesn't

9902
06:21:05,440 --> 06:21:06,958
it?

9903
06:21:05,840 --> 06:21:08,558
Yeah.

9904
06:21:06,958 --> 06:21:10,160
Consider it. I'll see what I can do. I

9905
06:21:08,558 --> 06:21:11,840
will raise a petition or something.

9906
06:21:10,160 --> 06:21:13,200
I'll raise the issue, you know, with the

9907
06:21:11,840 --> 06:21:14,878
board and we'll see what we can do.

9908
06:21:13,200 --> 06:21:16,240
Yep. We'll raise the bro tax in the

9909
06:21:14,878 --> 06:21:20,520
meantime. Time for us to head over to

9910
06:21:16,240 --> 06:21:20,520
the interview with Kroco though.

9911
06:21:20,798 --> 06:21:24,480
Thank you very much guys. This is dear

9912
06:21:22,638 --> 06:21:26,718
for the POM interview translation joined

9913
06:21:24,480 --> 06:21:29,718
by Kroco on the side of OK savings

9914
06:21:26,718 --> 06:21:29,718
thanks.

9915
06:21:30,160 --> 06:21:36,320
Thank you.

9916
06:21:33,040 --> 06:21:38,000
It's just the beginning of round three

9917
06:21:36,320 --> 06:21:40,638
and you've already achieved your second

9918
06:21:38,000 --> 06:21:42,400
win and PG pom in a row. How do you

9919
06:21:40,638 --> 06:21:44,160
feel?

9920
06:21:42,400 --> 06:21:47,798
You know, I think we all played out

9921
06:21:44,160 --> 06:21:47,798
really well overall.

9922
06:21:49,120 --> 06:21:53,840
You know,

9923
06:21:51,680 --> 06:21:55,840
our other teammates were saying, "Oh,

9924
06:21:53,840 --> 06:21:58,718
you're getting the PM again." And

9925
06:21:55,840 --> 06:22:01,040
they're just poking fun at me. But I

9926
06:21:58,718 --> 06:22:02,638
think we had such a great atmosphere

9927
06:22:01,040 --> 06:22:05,040
because we all knew that we do did

9928
06:22:02,638 --> 06:22:08,040
really well. All of us did quite well

9929
06:22:05,040 --> 06:22:08,040
today.

9930
06:22:08,878 --> 06:22:13,280
And today

9931
06:22:11,200 --> 06:22:16,240
marks new history for you guys. So every

9932
06:22:13,280 --> 06:22:18,160
time you faced DRX this year, it went to

9933
06:22:16,240 --> 06:22:22,080
a three game series which all ended up

9934
06:22:18,160 --> 06:22:24,160
going to DRX's way. So with today being

9935
06:22:22,080 --> 06:22:26,530
the day you shut them down, what do you

9936
06:22:24,160 --> 06:22:28,160
think was the key to today's victory?

9937
06:22:26,530 --> 06:22:31,920
[Music]

9938
06:22:28,160 --> 06:22:34,080
I feel like despite us being behind, I

9939
06:22:31,920 --> 06:22:37,280
think we just kept a really good mental

9940
06:22:34,080 --> 06:22:39,680
fortitude and were able to communicate

9941
06:22:37,280 --> 06:22:42,920
pretty positive. but positively within

9942
06:22:39,680 --> 06:22:42,920
the team.

9943
06:22:43,280 --> 06:22:50,000
That all ties back to you guys having a

9944
06:22:46,000 --> 06:22:52,320
great team spirit and atmosphere. And in

9945
06:22:50,000 --> 06:22:55,360
game two, it was so important to get a

9946
06:22:52,320 --> 06:22:57,520
pick on the enemy Lucian and you were

9947
06:22:55,360 --> 06:22:59,120
able to execute so well. So, how are you

9948
06:22:57,520 --> 06:23:01,600
able to make those decisions in the

9949
06:22:59,120 --> 06:23:04,400
pinch?

9950
06:23:01,600 --> 06:23:08,480
You know, Lucian has to be the weakest

9951
06:23:04,400 --> 06:23:11,520
against Vari comp. So I think our game

9952
06:23:08,480 --> 06:23:14,240
plan was honestly we had to strategize

9953
06:23:11,520 --> 06:23:17,878
around just getting the pick on Lucian

9954
06:23:14,240 --> 06:23:17,878
the entire game.

9955
06:23:18,320 --> 06:23:23,440
And in game three for your niti you got

9956
06:23:21,360 --> 06:23:26,400
a shoin and rift maker as your core

9957
06:23:23,440 --> 06:23:30,480
items. So what made you build them? Now,

9958
06:23:26,400 --> 06:23:34,160
rather than really focusing on the items

9959
06:23:30,480 --> 06:23:36,558
strength, I was just I just noticed that

9960
06:23:34,160 --> 06:23:39,920
one of our opponents during our scrim

9961
06:23:36,558 --> 06:23:42,160
were using these item builds and it

9962
06:23:39,920 --> 06:23:45,440
looked really good. So, I just tried

9963
06:23:42,160 --> 06:23:48,558
copying it,

9964
06:23:45,440 --> 06:23:51,360
but honestly, today it didn't seem too

9965
06:23:48,558 --> 06:23:53,440
good. So, I think I might have to put it

9966
06:23:51,360 --> 06:23:55,680
away for a bit until I see a better

9967
06:23:53,440 --> 06:23:57,600
angle next time.

9968
06:23:55,680 --> 06:23:59,920
And game three was so close that it was

9969
06:23:57,600 --> 06:24:02,080
impossible to predict who would win. So

9970
06:23:59,920 --> 06:24:06,160
what do you think was the game deciding

9971
06:24:02,080 --> 06:24:08,558
moment? Honestly, the soul dragon fight

9972
06:24:06,160 --> 06:24:11,280
and probably our team fighting at the

9973
06:24:08,558 --> 06:24:15,040
very end. I think that had the most

9974
06:24:11,280 --> 06:24:17,120
influence on ending the game.

9975
06:24:15,040 --> 06:24:19,680
And I feel like overall I feel like even

9976
06:24:17,120 --> 06:24:23,280
if we start out behind, we're able to

9977
06:24:19,680 --> 06:24:27,920
stay solid and bite out towards the end

9978
06:24:23,280 --> 06:24:29,840
until the end to close it out our way

9979
06:24:27,920 --> 06:24:33,280
and

9980
06:24:29,840 --> 06:24:35,360
of course there is a famous line from

9981
06:24:33,280 --> 06:24:37,360
you which is the jungle roll is all

9982
06:24:35,360 --> 06:24:39,600
about sharp decision making and intense

9983
06:24:37,360 --> 06:24:43,520
mind games. So did you have any moment

9984
06:24:39,600 --> 06:24:46,638
that stood out for you today?

9985
06:24:43,520 --> 06:24:49,840
I think for the VI game, I think I was

9986
06:24:46,638 --> 06:24:53,200
able to dodge and juke the enemy skill

9987
06:24:49,840 --> 06:24:56,240
shots and go in at the right time to get

9988
06:24:53,200 --> 06:24:58,798
a pick during those team fights. So, I

9989
06:24:56,240 --> 06:25:00,480
think that's what really

9990
06:24:58,798 --> 06:25:02,400
stands out in terms of outplaying my

9991
06:25:00,480 --> 06:25:04,400
opponent today.

9992
06:25:02,400 --> 06:25:06,718
Now that you start out round three

9993
06:25:04,400 --> 06:25:10,280
strong, what goals does okay savings

9994
06:25:06,718 --> 06:25:10,280
bank have?

9995
06:25:10,798 --> 06:25:15,280
I think we really want to focus on

9996
06:25:12,878 --> 06:25:18,400
improving our performance and obviously

9997
06:25:15,280 --> 06:25:20,558
our results and outcome

9998
06:25:18,400 --> 06:25:22,160
and improve our standings and I think

9999
06:25:20,558 --> 06:25:24,080
that's just the best that we can do from

10000
06:25:22,160 --> 06:25:26,798
our position

10001
06:25:24,080 --> 06:25:29,920
and that makes your next match against

10002
06:25:26,798 --> 06:25:33,480
BNK PRX so important. So what would you

10003
06:25:29,920 --> 06:25:33,480
like to say about those?

10004
06:25:34,400 --> 06:25:38,718
You know, I think we have a really good

10005
06:25:35,760 --> 06:25:41,040
feeling.

10006
06:25:38,718 --> 06:25:43,280
We had always been losing against TX and

10007
06:25:41,040 --> 06:25:45,360
BNK FX. So, I think this is the moment

10008
06:25:43,280 --> 06:25:48,000
that we can actually turn it all around

10009
06:25:45,360 --> 06:25:49,680
and create a good momentum. And that's

10010
06:25:48,000 --> 06:25:53,798
the end of the interview with Kroco. And

10011
06:25:49,680 --> 06:25:53,798
back to the space. Thank you.

10012
06:25:53,920 --> 06:25:57,360
Thank you so much, dear, for that

10013
06:25:55,280 --> 06:26:00,160
awesome translation. We made it to the

10014
06:25:57,360 --> 06:26:02,798
end and Bro was able to take the victory

10015
06:26:00,160 --> 06:26:04,240
just barely. It was very close down to

10016
06:26:02,798 --> 06:26:05,920
the wire, but then they kind of stomped

10017
06:26:04,240 --> 06:26:08,160
that last fight. So, very welld deserved

10018
06:26:05,920 --> 06:26:10,400
by the Bros for picking it up tonight.

10019
06:26:08,160 --> 06:26:12,080
Any any thoughts on that last game,

10020
06:26:10,400 --> 06:26:16,160
gentlemen? Any

10021
06:26:12,080 --> 06:26:18,878
Please don't build Niti like that.

10022
06:26:16,160 --> 06:26:19,760
Who was the scrim terrorist? Who did it?

10023
06:26:18,878 --> 06:26:22,240
Who's the guy

10024
06:26:19,760 --> 06:26:25,120
who infected Kro's brain?

10025
06:26:22,240 --> 06:26:26,798
I think we need to rebuild the player.

10026
06:26:25,120 --> 06:26:29,840
I think next time we we have to

10027
06:26:26,798 --> 06:26:32,000
Don't say that, Vald.

10028
06:26:29,840 --> 06:26:34,638
All right. Well, we did have to vote for

10029
06:26:32,000 --> 06:26:36,000
some palms. Um, you know, there were a

10030
06:26:34,638 --> 06:26:38,480
lot of thoughts about who was going to

10031
06:26:36,000 --> 06:26:40,638
be the palm for the side of

10032
06:26:38,480 --> 06:26:43,120
DRX and then they had to go for bro at

10033
06:26:40,638 --> 06:26:45,600
the end. Um, Soup and TZ once again kind

10034
06:26:43,120 --> 06:26:48,080
of uh not on the same page with us here.

10035
06:26:45,600 --> 06:26:49,280
Understandable. Uh, Vass going for

10036
06:26:48,080 --> 06:26:50,798
Morgan.

10037
06:26:49,280 --> 06:26:51,840
What do you guys think about that?

10038
06:26:50,798 --> 06:26:52,558
It's okay.

10039
06:26:51,840 --> 06:26:54,798
Atrox. Yeah,

10040
06:26:52,558 --> 06:26:57,680
jungle mid is is probably the way to go

10041
06:26:54,798 --> 06:27:00,400
just because

10042
06:26:57,680 --> 06:27:01,600
uh closer controlled the Arivi game and

10043
06:27:00,400 --> 06:27:05,558
then

10044
06:27:01,600 --> 06:27:05,558
I mean in fact they had

10045
06:27:05,920 --> 06:27:09,440
it was he played Casio and that's very

10046
06:27:07,680 --> 06:27:12,558
fun which might be why Soup and Giz

10047
06:27:09,440 --> 06:27:14,400
voted. Not sure about that

10048
06:27:12,558 --> 06:27:16,240
probably. So we're going to take a look

10049
06:27:14,400 --> 06:27:17,840
at some of the comments as well and see

10050
06:27:16,240 --> 06:27:20,160
what people thought about this one.

10051
06:27:17,840 --> 06:27:22,000
Crocco dialed in. Yeah, it's like cuz

10052
06:27:20,160 --> 06:27:26,080
he's a crocodile

10053
06:27:22,000 --> 06:27:26,558
crocodile. He's crocodiled in,

10054
06:27:26,080 --> 06:27:27,040
you know.

10055
06:27:26,558 --> 06:27:28,478
Yeah.

10056
06:27:27,040 --> 06:27:30,638
Nobody says dialed in anymore when it

10057
06:27:28,478 --> 06:27:32,000
says focused up, locked in, whatever.

10058
06:27:30,638 --> 06:27:32,558
But like if you want to make the pun

10059
06:27:32,000 --> 06:27:35,040
work,

10060
06:27:32,558 --> 06:27:37,760
you could have done like crocodiled in a

10061
06:27:35,040 --> 06:27:39,920
while crocodile. Take it like even one

10062
06:27:37,760 --> 06:27:41,360
step further.

10063
06:27:39,920 --> 06:27:42,638
Anyways, let's take a look at the next

10064
06:27:41,360 --> 06:27:44,718
comment.

10065
06:27:42,638 --> 06:27:47,440
All right. All right. Even though you

10066
06:27:44,718 --> 06:27:49,120
blamed the item build, his item build

10067
06:27:47,440 --> 06:27:50,878
actually saved him at the last moment

10068
06:27:49,120 --> 06:27:52,240
when when you remember Rise got the

10069
06:27:50,878 --> 06:27:54,798
triple kill in the D.

10070
06:27:52,240 --> 06:27:57,280
Yeah, the third item seekers arm guard.

10071
06:27:54,798 --> 06:27:59,440
He could actually jump left and right

10072
06:27:57,280 --> 06:28:01,920
because of his item build cuz he was a

10073
06:27:59,440 --> 06:28:04,718
lot tankier than uh any other build, you

10074
06:28:01,920 --> 06:28:06,478
know, that saved the team.

10075
06:28:04,718 --> 06:28:09,920
Um, but I don't want to see the item

10076
06:28:06,478 --> 06:28:13,040
build once again. That was so bad.

10077
06:28:09,920 --> 06:28:16,558
That's why he has a fan club. Yells

10078
06:28:13,040 --> 06:28:19,520
chronicler from the uh caster desk.

10079
06:28:16,558 --> 06:28:21,200
Thankfully his uh yeah Kroco the one

10080
06:28:19,520 --> 06:28:21,760
jump athlete.

10081
06:28:21,200 --> 06:28:23,600
See

10082
06:28:21,760 --> 06:28:24,798
um kind of makes sense. You know

10083
06:28:23,600 --> 06:28:25,920
throw the spear and then you have the

10084
06:28:24,798 --> 06:28:27,920
increased jump range.

10085
06:28:25,920 --> 06:28:30,080
No no no that that item build doesn't

10086
06:28:27,920 --> 06:28:33,040
care about the spear. All about all what

10087
06:28:30,080 --> 06:28:34,240
he matter is just jumping into the enemy

10088
06:28:33,040 --> 06:28:35,920
team. And

10089
06:28:34,240 --> 06:28:39,680
let's not give any credence to this

10090
06:28:35,920 --> 06:28:43,600
build. Come on. Um, the star of Rise are

10091
06:28:39,680 --> 06:28:46,000
the junglers. Like that.

10092
06:28:43,600 --> 06:28:48,000
Okay. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Makes

10093
06:28:46,000 --> 06:28:49,920
sense. All right. All right. Anything

10094
06:28:48,000 --> 06:28:53,280
else? Anything else from the Korean

10095
06:28:49,920 --> 06:28:55,760
side? Array of light in a dizzying game.

10096
06:28:53,280 --> 06:28:57,200
Sure. Cloud Templar. Keeping it real.

10097
06:28:55,760 --> 06:29:00,160
I want to hear if there's anything that

10098
06:28:57,200 --> 06:29:02,000
that's said about mid. Any um closer

10099
06:29:00,160 --> 06:29:02,798
voters?

10100
06:29:02,000 --> 06:29:03,840
Uh,

10101
06:29:02,798 --> 06:29:05,120
you just want to blame.

10102
06:29:03,840 --> 06:29:06,718
No, I just I'm just curious what they

10103
06:29:05,120 --> 06:29:12,080
have to say. If if the All right. There

10104
06:29:06,718 --> 06:29:13,760
he is. Right. KR cast. Yeah. Surpass me.

10105
06:29:12,080 --> 06:29:14,478
Okay, Pony.

10106
06:29:13,760 --> 06:29:15,840
All right, Pony.

10107
06:29:14,478 --> 06:29:16,638
So, how do you rate?

10108
06:29:15,840 --> 06:29:19,680
How do you rate?

10109
06:29:16,638 --> 06:29:22,798
I mean, he did get the last laugh, so I

10110
06:29:19,680 --> 06:29:25,600
suppose he didn't get surpassed.

10111
06:29:22,798 --> 06:29:27,600
Um, he did in the gold and in the damage

10112
06:29:25,600 --> 06:29:29,840
that was done in the game, but not in

10113
06:29:27,600 --> 06:29:31,440
game two where he just crushed him and

10114
06:29:29,840 --> 06:29:33,840
the zero was like one and five and the

10115
06:29:31,440 --> 06:29:36,718
revi worked out. Simple, easy to execute

10116
06:29:33,840 --> 06:29:38,478
composition. Yeah. Best individual year.

10117
06:29:36,718 --> 06:29:40,638
Yeah.

10118
06:29:38,478 --> 06:29:42,160
Yeah. Closers. You know, if you're

10119
06:29:40,638 --> 06:29:43,520
voting for like best individual year,

10120
06:29:42,160 --> 06:29:46,400
then I understand those pawn votes.

10121
06:29:43,520 --> 06:29:48,160
Otherwise, yeah. No, no more Cassiopia.

10122
06:29:46,400 --> 06:29:49,840
Let's take a look at the standings here

10123
06:29:48,160 --> 06:29:51,360
uh after that game because these two

10124
06:29:49,840 --> 06:29:53,840
teams were kind of close. You know, Bro

10125
06:29:51,360 --> 06:29:57,280
was ahead and now they're going to take

10126
06:29:53,840 --> 06:29:59,920
one step farther further into the lead

10127
06:29:57,280 --> 06:30:01,440
and DRX will remain in fourth place of

10128
06:29:59,920 --> 06:30:04,798
the Rise Group, which is technically

10129
06:30:01,440 --> 06:30:07,520
ninth. It's a 20 week for Bro.

10130
06:30:04,798 --> 06:30:10,320
They're now their next opponent is BNK

10131
06:30:07,520 --> 06:30:12,160
who they're tied with in wins. They get

10132
06:30:10,320 --> 06:30:13,920
that eighth win. They jump up to second

10133
06:30:12,160 --> 06:30:17,120
place. So, they're coming for D+ who

10134
06:30:13,920 --> 06:30:18,240
they already beat. Bro, could be the

10135
06:30:17,120 --> 06:30:20,878
key.

10136
06:30:18,240 --> 06:30:24,400
That's huge. Well, I mean, I have I

10137
06:30:20,878 --> 06:30:26,478
mean, I I have a huge disappointment for

10138
06:30:24,400 --> 06:30:29,680
today's game from DRX cuz the last game

10139
06:30:26,478 --> 06:30:32,478
was definitely wable, but uh I could see

10140
06:30:29,680 --> 06:30:34,000
Reach was tilting and he was like just

10141
06:30:32,478 --> 06:30:35,760
straight up dying four times in a row

10142
06:30:34,000 --> 06:30:38,080
even though the game was wable. So, I

10143
06:30:35,760 --> 06:30:40,718
feel like if DRX can fix that mental

10144
06:30:38,080 --> 06:30:42,798
issue, they have the fundamentals. Yeah,

10145
06:30:40,718 --> 06:30:44,878
we were watching and you pointed out he

10146
06:30:42,798 --> 06:30:46,558
got his teleport cancelled like what was

10147
06:30:44,878 --> 06:30:48,958
it 4 minutes into the game

10148
06:30:46,558 --> 06:30:51,200
and he was actually that moment his

10149
06:30:48,958 --> 06:30:51,760
mental was out the windows game was

10150
06:30:51,200 --> 06:30:54,638
getting late

10151
06:30:51,760 --> 06:30:57,280
plates after that for free. Yeah. Oh, he

10152
06:30:54,638 --> 06:30:58,798
was very far behind. So tomorrow Wolf

10153
06:30:57,280 --> 06:31:00,320
and I are going to be casting this. It's

10154
06:30:58,798 --> 06:31:02,798
been a late day. It's an early morning

10155
06:31:00,320 --> 06:31:05,440
tomorrow with the earlier start. DK up

10156
06:31:02,798 --> 06:31:07,040
against BNK. That should be pretty fun

10157
06:31:05,440 --> 06:31:09,680
especially because DK are coming off of

10158
06:31:07,040 --> 06:31:12,080
a loss to Bro. And then we got Homal

10159
06:31:09,680 --> 06:31:14,080
Life Sports up against KT. I would say

10160
06:31:12,080 --> 06:31:15,360
currently KT are probably heavily

10161
06:31:14,080 --> 06:31:15,840
favored for that one. Should be

10162
06:31:15,360 --> 06:31:17,360
interesting.

10163
06:31:15,840 --> 06:31:18,080
Yeah, the second match up is a lot

10164
06:31:17,360 --> 06:31:20,000
sassy.

10165
06:31:18,080 --> 06:31:21,600
Yeah, I really like that second match

10166
06:31:20,000 --> 06:31:22,400
up. I think my match of the week to be

10167
06:31:21,600 --> 06:31:24,400
honest.

10168
06:31:22,400 --> 06:31:26,160
We did see Han Life play that one close

10169
06:31:24,400 --> 06:31:28,160
game against Genji, but otherwise have

10170
06:31:26,160 --> 06:31:29,280
been looking really out of sorts. KT

10171
06:31:28,160 --> 06:31:30,400
Rollster.

10172
06:31:29,280 --> 06:31:32,558
Really looking forward to seeing what

10173
06:31:30,400 --> 06:31:34,878
this this team is going to show us after

10174
06:31:32,558 --> 06:31:36,558
a rocky start to the week from them. I

10175
06:31:34,878 --> 06:31:37,760
think we had higher expectations, but it

10176
06:31:36,558 --> 06:31:40,798
should be a really fun one. I mean,

10177
06:31:37,760 --> 06:31:44,878
personally, I think HLE's game win plan

10178
06:31:40,798 --> 06:31:47,200
is like somewhat gone for now. So, I

10179
06:31:44,878 --> 06:31:48,638
just want to see how they can bounce

10180
06:31:47,200 --> 06:31:51,120
back with their team.

10181
06:31:48,638 --> 06:31:53,120
Yeah, KT the perfect team to just strike

10182
06:31:51,120 --> 06:31:54,320
when the enemy is weakest. And I think

10183
06:31:53,120 --> 06:31:55,680
they might be able to do it tomorrow,

10184
06:31:54,320 --> 06:31:57,280
but you'll have to wait until tomorrow

10185
06:31:55,680 --> 06:31:58,718
to see. That's it for us, guys. Thank

10186
06:31:57,280 --> 06:32:00,320
you so much for watching, and we'll see

10187
06:31:58,718 --> 06:32:14,060
you tomorrow.

Summer 2021 ｜ Edward Gaming vs Victory Five G1.en.plain.txt","fixed_text":"offs so for edg despite being in first you definitely want to try and lock in that top two spot it's super important especially we labeled it out earlier right like you control your own destiny right now if you can get two o's across the board jiejie looking to go down now has popped the ragnarok there's a lot of help viper is actually here for the fight as well so there's a lot of follow-up damage from this ezreal see if they can catch him v5 is a little bit split but now they're joining back up a lot of poke coming in from edg though they're gonna push v5 off the point here and continue to work this vision game while this dragon spawns and this is finally what we wanted to see out from edg right when you're not able to play sides when you're not able to look for those picks edg need to be a team that's grouping up on mid wave looking for the contest because you outrange victory five's composition so you will always win the contest over mid wave you'll always be able to walk into river first unless they're entering from sides and then you can just try and whittle them out because other than the enchanted crystal arrow they're only true oh god flandre using that cs lead we were talking about there on the pzx but he might have found aliez here dragon does go down that will be soul point for edg v5 not able to respond and i mean nice damage coming out from flandre still forced to back by aliez and actually having to burn his flash so maybe not the best in the end especially because you're a lot like right you're more mobile than graves you do not have a dash like he does you're also not as tanky as him in terms of the items that you are building so flandre i think it'll be hurting a little bit though i could understand why he looked for that one almost did find the solo kill but going back to our point before edg need to be grouping up first they need to be looking to get their poke down because unless someone just extends too far forward and is open to an enchanted crystal arrow i don't feel like victory five have an easy way of actually forcing a fight without denying vision and coming off an angle that edg don't expect it looks like they want to force a fight anyways lyric because they were moving in to try and catch out meiko not gonna find it though you get the side lane push coming in from flandre v5 not really able to find anything at the moment but there's no real big objectives on the map you're just looking at tempo of the lanes and how these side lanes are going to work out but as you said edg obviously changing the game plan this far into the game and i could appreciate that for v5 though you've gotten a lot of picks you've gotten a decent amount

wanted to say about where the gold lead is for rng is of course on the top side of the map you see the two kills on both the diana and the gwen but more importantly and this is something i think is

maybe should still take it all the same because it's a very powerful room for her um it just allows lucian to escape some of those nerfs a little bit more we saw blade nerf we saw shave and kraken be nerf a lot of these level one for the first items rather coming in from carries but he's managed to escape the nerfs a fair bit and that's why we're still seeing him being first picked here right now

with a kill is not ideal is it Hoya and Zdz have both hit level six at this point on a level six is always quite a nerve-wracking moment in any game grubs are up on the top side of the map Drake is up on the bottom side of the map TT have loved those Drakes historically Life moves into the mid lane so does Feather and Beichuan desperately fighting over here but Care has such a huge wave to work with as a bonus hit onto Ucal as well in the meantime milkyway will grab these grubs pretty much uncontested yeah one thing which you can see on show there is um of course Press the Attack being really strong of course we saw that Fleet Footwork and Absorb Life being nerfed a little bit Life should be okay here but um the fact that Lucian and Tristana can kind of get away with not taking Fleet Footwork I think that Tristana maybe should still take it all the same because it's a very powerful rune for her um it just allows Lucian to escape some of those Nerfs a little bit more we saw blade Nerf we saw Shiv and Kraken Slayer be nerfed a lot of these level one for the first items rather coming in from carries but he's managed to escape the Nerfs a fair bit and that's why we're still seeing him being first picked here right now I definitely think he's also just like purely subjectively one of the more interesting AD mid laners","gpt-5-mini_newfix":"well for FPX or at least the mid part of that working out pretty well for FPX early on but this time it's very much because of Ucal's mistake and that Tristana which we said could be potentially powerful it was banned in that first game not working out really towards their favorite 2v2 at least working out for ThunderTalk Gaming which of course happened in that last game too but they need to keep eyes on this mid lane now that's not how you want these early games to be going I'm just surprised that Ucal I guess he was trying to stop a potential recall from Care but just you know face planting into that brush all the way to do it and milkyway happened to be in the area as well it really just couldn't have got much worse for Ucal I'm sure he'll be regretting it and scratching his head just as much as we are here on the casters we'll see how that continues to develop but as you say Care actually looked good on the Lucian in the previous game didn't really manage to impact the fights though was the big issue of the pick with a Lillia though and with a Rakan as well with a Care'Sante it does feel like a bit of a shorter-range comp I feel like he'll have more space to get in amongst these plays when you've got everyone else diving into yeah real I think the one thing which can stop that potentially is is really good Ivern play we'll see how well Beichuan can stop that later on but then that becomes a completely different uh question later on so let's go talk about that jungle match up then we talk about betron milkyway milkyway got himself that first blood which of course gives him that faded

blue buff but was not able to do so i think that maybe would have given him level four and definitely would have made him a little bit more of a threat with that second level in the q but not to be so already we're seeing that the xun kha'zix kind of being a bit more aggressive recognizing look i could be far more impactful if i can make these things work yagao just don't need to be that far pushed

Kha'Zix kind of being a bit more aggressive recognizing look I could be far more impactful if I can make these things work wow just don't need to be that far pushed up he's going low and he is going to go down a flash Away by Xiaohao means that he stays alive you are getting that isolation damage now from Xun but not enough to really keep him going nice sidestep there from ON but he's probably gonna hide flash to keep himself alive just about does it and that's the aggressively aggressive start to this we saw we thought we would see in this bot lane from Zorah in the Nami, Anyone's Legend are taking Bilibili Gaming to task here we talked about that if Xun's early game plans are set behind there's an Avenue for anybody for really any team to take advantage of Bilibili Gaming but this time they answered in the mid lane Xiaohao moving in the mid getting the flash out and then bottom Lane still playing aggressively as ever that ignite was used pretty early ON so it's going to come back soon and that's another window for Anyone's Legend you find more and more gold finding more and more of an advantage here wait to see if Anyone's Legend could do much more with it I do like that they're just kind of focusing a little bit ON Yagao kind of saying look I'm not gonna let this Annie just kind of get up to six without a without a care in the world definitely throwing a couple more um curveballs the way of Anyone's Legend you guys gonna have to play a bit more respectfully ON without a flash now ON the bot side also needs to be a bit careful with how and when he looks to try and be aggressive but for the moment Bilibili Gaming happy to kind of just let this game go a little bit longer they've got the Cull picked up here for Elk so he's gonna just try and stack that one up as long as he possibly can and then top side they're happy to let this Top Lane go equal as best they possibly can so again it's down to Anyone's Legend to try and make sure they're punishing out a lot of these Bilibili Gaming members without their Summoners as we get closer to more and more of these fights we're going to be looking at the influence of the mid lane we've talked about Annie too I think but for Gragas it is all about getting ","gpt-5-nano_newfix":" now but uh let's uh let's let's calm it down just a little bit and honestly you can't really blame them right now because again undefeated in series doing exceptionally well to keep that streak going we are not going to see that ward catch out on the Kha'Zix Yagao is very far pushed forward right now and without a stun to his name gonna find it very difficult to really go for it yeah immediate flash there from your girl recognizing he was in trouble has to respect the flash belly Bop big respect going over to Xiaohao who is the primary engine for this team and this guy has a insane KP at 15 he's the first in junglers when we followed by Xun who is a part of every single first blood for this team and right now he's

crazy stuff coming out of the top lane role as well Betty might just pull out something like a Quinn depending on what Anyone's Legend pick the world's their oyster and far beaten far from me to get off the beaten track oh we see some pretty standard bans and i love that there's still the Lucian there but how do you round this up am i yeah should i be like asking for a top lane Yasuo or something that works in conjunction with Diana apart from i love that they did this right so he hit on the Nautilus probably being the fourth pick for Ming i would have been so sad if they would have gone for a top lane pick here just because one you have the trinomials of flex don't show your hand keep them guessing two the fact that you've left been on an island so frequently i think it means you should be prioritizing a counter pick role for him because he's gonna be playing by himself he needs a good matchup where he can play without jungle uh intervention over the other side though Leona looks like it will be the go-to choice for the side of Anyone's Legend and now top lane blind i mean we have the Gwen which is probably the safest and most comfortable champion you could go up towards in that role or maybe honestly that's kind of it i'm kind of just looking at the Gwen the fact that Jax and Diana are banned out i think other blinds are not as good yeah but on the other side i mean does that mean Bin just goes Jax, like like he usually would my guess is yes i feel like you probably do just get the counter match up play by yourself for RNG you already have this matchup you're comfortable with in the mid lane uh the only thing i don't like is i don't think there's anything too good holistically for RNG's comp to round out because you have these these three diving champions right Tryndamere Diana and Nautilus","gpt-4.1_newfix":"left over and rng are going in a completely different direction especially if they're picking up something like the Lillia or the Diana i mean this would be a change of pace to a boring pick and ban that a lot of fans were expecting you know throughout the rest of the week too i have no idea what is going on hysterics you look at Anyone's Legend comp in this meta you could you could you could actually close your eyes whatever's happening on rg's side if you look at anyone's legends cop you'll be like wow this team is going to win they're getting the esteer picks in every role rng does not care they're coming in full force with a bunch of all-in champions like to Diana like the Tryndamere i think Aphelios will have a rough time playing against the Jinx and the Corki as we've highlighted so many times which is why it's surprised me they opted into it but for energy i guess you're just continuing to opt into more all-in champions get a tank in the support role we know ming has favored the nautilus that would fit quite well in here going up against the jinx and Corki and then we're going to be looking at at mid and

be playing by himself he needs a good matchup where he can play without jungle uh intervention over the other side though leona looks like it will be the go-to choice for the side of Anyone's Legend

looking at the Gwen the fact that Jayce and Gragas are banned out i think other blinds are not as good yeah but on the other side i mean does that mean bin just goes Jax on lyric like he usually would

be any on any sort of timer like they were game one and they are in a favorable position shy getting all in now by 369 but he turns around with the cyclone and maybe this is a bad move from 369 in the worst of that one now fight in the mid lane i'm not entirely sure who's here but Xun taken low gets the sleep onto the enemy mid laner hey make it to get the shield patrol flashes out to safety puff puts his mark on the game and we didn't get to see how that one started but nice finish coming out from Zhuo doing a ton of damage with that haymaker buying a lot of time but this part is very similar to game one where JackeyLove left on his island picking up all the plates it doesn't end a dive on Knight and there's nothing he can do about a kill for Rookie XinLiu survives on a modicum of health just calculating the play perfectly and puff now moves down to the bottom side to answer for their herald that's going to charge on through into the tower they will get the charge but it doesn't matter all too much yeah still top esports are the ones with the tower lead they now also have a pressure point on the map to play through they should be able to consistently push out that bot wave you know past river someone on ig has to answer but Xun throwing out the swirl seed yeah no sleep available right now for Xun so he can't follow up on the swirl seed he's just buying space for TheShy to get that recall off he's going to clear the wave and leave the top lane alone this just stops 369 being able to really punish the recoil from TheShy and it means TheShy doesn't have to use his tp that's really nice for him his oat will","gpt-4o-mini_newfix":"tting the herald and thank god we're gonna get a replay this time it's like what i'm talking about ig trying to focus on draw on the opposite side focus on the herald TheShy instantly gonna go down between Karsa and 369 and then we see a really nice scatter of the week coming out from rookie but it doesn't matter because knight's been left untouched and Zhuo and Karsa are both so tanky they do end up getting another kill in the end but still nice win for the side of tes and carsa 2-0-2 on the hecarim now and the same story in game number one right it was Karsa on the hecarim and in the early game he got ahead even though ig won game number one it was top esports leading to start things out once we got into the bigger team fights the ig really started to pop off but let's talk compositions quickly while we've got a minute here because once again it does feel like ig very much about the early game with this Kalista much more scaling on the side of top esports so realistically we need to see ig take control of the game exactly both very skirmish and team fight heavy just about when they want to do it i do think ig have much more burst damage this time around so even if it does go a bit later there's always a chance if someone overstepped just a little bit someone from ig jumps in and top esports are just dead

make it down towards bot get some gold on JackeyLove and really get him going finish up the storm razor but it looks like it is gonna probably end up being towards mid even if not right now just the fact that Rookie has been uh keeping up consistent pressure just makes it a very easy place to drop the herald and gives Rookie even more leniency in being able to roam and make plays on the map just a little bit of gold there only the single plate actually taken but gets priority gets the Drake and uh like you say potentially sets up for the second Herald this Wayward actual","o3_newfix":"able to find the return kill on Tarzan but still LNG do a great job of knowing hey we're too late on Tempo to make a play for Rift Herald Let's cross map for bot side and seeing JackeyLove and Mark covering mid wave set up the trap in their own blue side jungle and that's fantastic because I mean it's like fundamentally just win the trade right three plates on the bottom side Herald only gets you a plate and a half sure there's a little bit more gold from actually picking up Herald so outright gold perhaps fairly even but in terms of where you're getting that gold GALA getting in three plates worth you take that like look he's already gone crazy especially now after the turret changes on this patch where they've made it harder to keep pushing down plates after you've taken the first one all right kind of saying in the patch that's one of the things they want to get away from right they still want you to feel like if you make like a dive or or a gank or like a Herald play on one side you get rewarded but they don't just outright want it to break open the game the same way that it did before to be fair I don't know if like the turret plates having a bit more uh resistances right after one goes down really is that drastic of a change but still a little bit of a change to try to help teams not get snowballed against as hard I love this from The Observers just highlighting the wards in the bottom Lane TPs are available we're past 10 minutes so it's very possible oh that sweeper didn't quite see the ward Wayward still has TP Rookie has TP yeah highly possible for shenanigans to occur here just looking for the crab in the meantime Scout's moving over we'll find that control ward in the brush I do gotta say that is one of my favorite changes of the patch because the Unleashed timer going down League maybe back in the day like TPing down at like three minutes was too much or just kind of annoying but you know 14 minutes it was way too long I want my top laners involved in Shenanigans right now which we actually have lots of having a lot of posturing for shenanigans sadly none can actually be followed through on it's a it's a shenanigans situation unfortunately as uh a bit of a wet noodle fight up at the top side we've got some 5K versus almost for Sunfire Cape so realistically this is Never Gonna lead to much until they get involved with the rest of the team very quiet early game between the two teams but I can kind of get it and I feel like with Drake spawning now on the next Herald as well perhaps those are our catalysts for something to kick off yeah
